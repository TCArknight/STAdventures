Additionally, once per mission, you may spend a scene counseling a character who has challenged one of their values during the current mission.

While the development of the universal translator has reduced the need for translators during daily life in the 23rd and 24th centuries, there are still situations which call for experts in linguistics. Encounters with new cultures often require support from xenolinguistics experts to smooth over any problems that the universal translator has, particularly if a culture has an unusual style or method of communication. Similarly, archaeological research often requires piecing together extinct languages from evidence in ways that can’t easily be automated.\n\n{b}ROLE BENEFIT:{/b} When attempting to read, understand, or speak a language unfamiliar to you, you may spend 2 Momentum (Immediate) to piece together a basic understanding of that language immediately, enough to convey simple ideas. This allows social tasks to be attempted in this language, but the complication range of these tasks is increased to 18–20. Deeper study, at the gamemaster’s discretion, allows you to remove this penalty and discuss more complex ideas." compset="CharRole" summary="When attempting to read, understand, or speak a language unfamiliar to you, you may spend 2 Momentum (Immediate) to piece together a basic understanding of that language immediately, enough to convey simple ideas, but the complication range is 18+." uniqueness="useronce">
