  <thing id="foSmallCra" name="Small Craft" description="The character flies shuttles, runabouts, and fighters as if they were an extensions of their own body. These handle differently from starships and, while this doesn’t matter during routine flights, skill with small craft can be the difference between life and death in a crisis. Many small craft need only one or two flight crew, so this Focus cover operations, tactical Tasks, engineering problems, and the to-be-expected piloting and navigation." compset="Focus">

  <thing id="foStarRec" name="Starship Recognition" description="The character has a broad knowledge of different classes and types of starship, and can recognize them by visual appearance, thermal and radiation emissions, and by a number of other indicators. This is not just useful trivia, as the character can spot deviations from an expected baseline and so is able to identify, for example, when a ship has been modified or is producing false signals." compset="Focus">

The past can have useful parallels to today, and can help when avoiding repeated mistakes. As with Cultural Studies, this Focus may be renamed to reflect the character’s knowledge: a character with a Focus of History may have a broad understanding of the past, while a character with 21st Century Earth History will know about events and people specific to that era." compset="Focus">

They draw upon this knowledge when attempting to be inspiring, or persuasive, or trying to reach an audience. Effective where an audience is familiar with a work or style, some artistic sensibilities do not translate between species. This Focus could be renamed for specific art disciplines and specific cultures’ arts.

  <thing id="foDecept" name="Deception" description="The character is a talented liar, and capable of spotting the same in others. Starfleet does not condone deception; it is a matter of pride that Starfleet officers do not lie. But even if officers are true to themselves and speak honestly when it counts, calculated deception is a necessary tactic. Of course, knowing how to lie is an important part of spotting when others might be lying." compset="Focus">

They might be accustomed to games like poker, or the Ferengi dabo and tongo, where both luck and skill are needed. Not unheard of amongst Starfleet officers — weighing up a perilous situation is important as long as leaders take responsibility for the consequences — such characters may have the {i}Bold{/i} Talent (page 135 of the {b}Star Trek Adventures{/b} core rulebook) to reflect their willingness to take chances." compset="Focus">

  <thing id="foInspire" name="Inspiration" description="The character is an inspiration to others, helping them overcome fears and doubts during a crisis. Even Starfleet officers, determined as they are, rely on inspiring leadership in difficult situations. An inspirational character can get the most from subordinates, reinvigorating the weary and rallying the demoralized. Inspiring characters are often vital where the stakes are high and success seems distant." compset="Focus">

  <thing id="foLaw" name="Law" description="The character has studied the Federation legal code, and laws of other cultures too, and is expert enough to provide counsel during trials, or pass judgement in criminal matters.

  <thing id="foLbE" name="Lead By Example" description="The character excels at leading by doing, and ‘gets their hands dirty’. They do not sit back and delegate, and never give an order they would not follow. These are practical leaders unafraid to test their own skills and who expect subordinates to follow without hesitation. Characters with this Focus have moved to the command department from some other part of Starfleet, and are used to relying on their own skills rather than directing others." compset="Focus">

    </thing>
  <thing id="foLinguist" name="Linguistics" description="The character has a broad knowledge of communication and fluency in several languages. Despite the universal translator people still study languages, partly in case of technical faults or encounters with unfamiliar cultures, and partly because language is an important expression of cultural and societal evolution. Early in Starfleet history, ships often carried linguists to expand the universal translator and help communicate with unfamiliar cultures." compset="Focus">

    </thing>
  <thing id="foMentDisc" name="Mental Discipline" description="The character has learned to control their thoughts, emotions and even parts of their subconscious. Mental discipline is rare and needs considerable effort to learn, but it offers an invaluable defense against telepathic intrusion. It is a bulwark against fear, panic, and despair, aids the recall of details, and allows tasks to be done despite distractions like pain. Vulcans, particularly those who have undergone the ritual of {i}Kolinahr{/i}, are likely to have this Focus, but they are not the only ones. Cardassians are often trained in childhood giving them eidetic memories, and allowing them to attempt protection from telepaths." compset="Focus">

    </thing>
  <thing id="foNegotia" name="Negotiation" description="The character is a deal-maker, finding mutual advantage — or the appearance of it — in all manner of social situations. Negotiation frequently involves trade or resource distribution, and those involved seek an outcome that both sides find acceptable.

Ferengi are notorious for their enthusiasm for negotiation, but also for their tendency to deceive others to get a better deal." compset="Focus">

This is\na complex subject, with countless schools of thought\nand each culture contains numerous philosophies.\nThis Focus may indicate that the character has studied many different schools of thought, or it may be renamed to indicate the character’s deep study of a single philosophy. For example, a character could study Vulcan Philosophy, considering the teachings of Surak, the principles of logic and emotional control. Philosophy applies to Tasks where a character tries to understand a problem, or needs to determine an approach to the problem. It may also apply during social conflicts when attempting to explain matters effectively." compset="Focus">

This includes the Federation’s democratic values, but also theories behind other cultures and regimes. It covers internal dynamics that create laws that shape society. This Focus is most valuable when studying or discussing different forms of society and government, such as during debates over whether a course of action contravenes a society’s mores.

  <thing id="foTeamDyn" name="Team Dynamics" description="The character has a deep understanding of how groups interact and how best to gain the best results through cooperation. This applies to small teams, rather than a starship’s entire crew, as not all team dynamics scale easily.

  <thing id="foAtmoFli" name="Atmospheric Flight" description="The character excels at operating aircraft and small spacecraft in an atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure, air resistance, wind speed and gravity make atmospheric flight different to spaceflight, and understanding those differences can have a considerable impact when flying in rough conditions.

This involves evading enemy fire, moving to maximize the tactical officer’s chances of hitting a target, moving as part of combat formations, and navigating crowded and chaotic battles. Combat maneuvers depend on the size and agility of a ship. Massive vessels like Galaxy-class starships are fast, but their size means that they’re used to shield smaller vessels, or to anchor a battle line, rather than to fly a precise course through the heart of the enemy line." compset="Focus">

  <thing id="foEvasive" name="Evasive Action" description="A character skilled in evasive actions keeps the ship safe and intact.

  <thing id="foGroundV" name="Ground Vehicles" description="While ground vehicles are not commonplace thanks to transporters and simple aircraft, the character can operate and maintain them. This expertise also includes the history of such vehicles, as many of them are historical objects in their own right. While this may seem irrelevant in Starfleet, some planetary conditions make ground transport a necessity, and a few exploratory and combat vessels produced all-terrain vehicles for use when needed." compset="Focus">
