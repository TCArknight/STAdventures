    description="The character is defined by their potential more than their skill. Their raw talent and their expectations of what the universe is like have not yet been tempered by reality.\n\nThe character is inexperienced, but talented and with a bright future in Starfleet. The character may not have or increase any Attribute above 11, or any Discipline above 4 while they have this Talent (and may have to adjust Attributes and Disciplines accordingly at the end of character creation). Whenever the character succeeds at a Task for which they bought one or more additional dice with either Momentum or Threat, they may roll 1[D]. The character receives bonus Momentum equal to the roll, and adds one point to Threat if an Effect is rolled. The character cannot gain any higher rank than lieutenant (junior grade) while they possess this Talent.\n\nTalent: Untapped Potential">
