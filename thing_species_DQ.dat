  <thing id="spcAnkari" name="Ankari" description="{b}ATTRIBUTES:{/b} +1 Fitness, +1 Insight, +1 Presence\n\n{b}EXAMPLE VALUE:{/b} {i}Fortune Favors the Faithful{/i}\n\nThe Ankari are a reptilian-humanoid species native to the Delta Quadrant. While warp capable, they\nprefer to use a form of FTL drive, believed to phase their craft into a parallel realm – similar to, but\ndistinct from, subspace. This realm is also home to a unique nucleogenic lifeform, whose bodies contain\nsignificant amounts of nucleogenic energy. Much like traditional subspace/warp-based civilizations,\nmost forms of Ankari technology interface with this nucleogenic realm. As this technology is so rare, few\nspecies can accurately detect or track Ankari vessels.\n\nDespite this strategic advantage, the Ankari are not a warlike people. Their relationship with the\ninterdimensional beings, whom the Ankari consider heralds of good fortune, has created a unique cultural\ndynamic. While technologically and scientifically advanced, the Ankari are traditionally a deeply spiritual\npeople and the interdimensional beings factor heavily in that belief system. The Ankari\nare welcoming of strangers and are open to trade, often celebrating the conclusion\nof successful endeavors with a summoning to bid their new allies good fortune." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

Jye can be found throughout the quadrant, usually under the employ of a host species, struggling with some problem that is beyond their ability or desire to address. The Jye believe this to be the greatest export their species has to offer, and take great strides to ensure that any circumstance they’ve been  retained on results in a satisfactory outcome for their employers. The Jye believe that they have a sworn duty to uphold the contracts they have been assigned to, and will work tirelessly to ensure that these business arrangements are properly governed and result in successful outcomes to the satisfaction of the employing government or culture.\n\nFor the most part, the Jye are an unremarkable humanoid species, with pale skin sporting lavender\nspots and little to no facial hair. Due to their role as administrators and organizers, the Jye are not often\nexposed to manual labor or exercise." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="spcLiberatedBorg" name="Liberated Borg" description="{b}ATTRIBUTES:{/b} +1 Control, +1 Fitness, +1 Reason\n\n{B}EXAMPLE VALUE:{/b} {i}What Does It Mean To Be An Individual?{/i}\n\nThe true power of the Borg comes from the nearly infinite number of drones that have been assimilated into the collective, like slaves of ancient civilizations. Thousands upon thousands of species have been forcibly pressed into service, their individuality stripped away in the most horrific way imaginable. For centuries, these poor souls had no hope of escape, condemned to a life of servitude aboard Borg ships, installations, and planets. Worse, once fully brought into the hive mind, they would seek out and visit the same fate upon anyone and everyone unfortunate enough to cross their path.\n\nBut in the last few decades, more and more drones have been separated from the collective � either intentionally or by some twist of fate. Once removed from the grip of the cacophony of voices speaking as one, the identity of these lucky few can begin to resurface, and they have the opportunity to try and regain the life that was taken from them. Liberated Borg, as they have become known, are as different and distinct from each other as any other individual member of a species. Some want only to return to the simplicity of existence that the collective offers, and will work tirelessly to become one with the Borg again. Others, invigorated by their release, embrace life with exuberant abandon. Regardless of their response to their new-found freedom, all must contend with the difficulties that their new life brings: rehabilitation, reintegration, and reintroduction to life as a solitary individual." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="spcLokirrim" name="Lokirrim" description="{b}ATTRIBUTES:{/b} +1 Daring, +1 Insight, +1 Reason\n\n{b}EXAMPLE VALUE:{/b} {i}Our Creations Will Submit{/i}\n\nFew other species possess the technical acumen with\nholograms to match the Lokirrim. For centuries, they\ndeveloped and utilized detailed holographic programs\nto perform countless tasks – effectively creating a task-specific \nservitor race. As their holograms became increasing\nsophisticated, with ever evolving mental capacity, it was\ninevitable that a conflict would erupt. And so it did. For\ndecades, the Lokirrim have been engaged in an ongoing\ncivil war against their creations. The photonic insurgency\nhas been devastating for the Lokirrim, which have become\ntotally dependent on their creations to perform the numerous\nhazardous or menial tasks necessary for modern life.\n\nUnfortunately, Lokirrim photonics were not satisfied with\nescaping their circumstances. The insurgency has struck at\nLokirrim society, using everything from civil disobedience\nto terror attacks to attempt to force the liberation of all\nphotonics. The rebellion has left most Lokirrim resentful of\nphotonic life, as they have watched their society teeter on\nthe brink of disaster and seen many loved ones lost to the\nattacks carried out by their former servants. Many willingly\njoined the Lokirrim naval forces to track down and destroy\nnot only those holograms that originated on Lokirr, but any\nindependent holograms, as the Lokirrim view them as a\ndanger to all organic life." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

While they are now known for\nbeing pacifists, the Mari were plagued by violent crime\nup until a few short decades ago. At that time, the Mari\noutlawed violent thought and introduced a procedural\ntechnique that allowed them to extract aggressive\nthoughts from their minds. This resulted in a drastic\nreduction in crime and now the Mari enjoy an almost\ncrime-free society. Unfortunately, this technique is not\nalways successful – and when it fails, they employ a much\nmore invasive medical procedure that restructures the\nneural pathways in the brain.\n\nWhile many may consider this kind of “thought policing” to be a violation of basic sentient rights, the Mari believe\nthat it is necessary to ensure the peaceful existence of\ntheir species. While welcoming to visitors, the Mari enforce\ntheir system of justice on outsiders as well as natives when\nsuch visitations result in impacts to the local populace.\n\nAggressive species such as Klingons are likely to come into\nimmediate conflict with the Mari who, despite their pacifistic\nnature, will respond if provoked.\n\nRegardless of their utopian lifestyle, there is a dark\nundertone to Mari culture. With the removal of all aggressive\nor violent thought, a black market has developed to provide\nsensory recreations of such offending thought patterns.\n\nMany Mari pay handsomely to experience these forbidden\nthoughts. Unfortunately, without the experience to control\nthese powerful emotions, Mari can succumb to them and\nbecome violent themselves. Due to their sensitive empathic\nabilities, these illegal thoughts can then spread like a\nvirus through the population – hence the Mari’s stance on\npreventing exposure in the first place." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

Centuries\nago, however, they discovered a unique planetary body, an artificial world composed entirely of water.\n\nUpon this world, the Moneans settled and built an entire civilization in the shallow region near the planet’s\nsurface. While they have created this underwater realm, most Moneans continue to live aboard their\nstarships and only occasionally venture into the depths of their new home. Exploration of the Waters, the\nname the Moneans have given their adopted world, has been hampered by the crushing depths of the\nocean. The Moneans only have the barest of understanding of the origin of this unique planetoid.\n\nMonean government reflects their aquatic origin, having been named the\nMaritime Supremacy. They maintain a reasonably powerful fleet of starships,\nthough despite this, the Moneans have not ventured beyond more than a few\nhundred light-years. Ancient navigational charts have long since become\noutdated, and the Monean origin world has long since faded into myth." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="spcOcampa" name="Ocampa" description="{b}ATTRIBUTES:{/b} +1 Control, +1 Insight, +1 Presence\n\n{b}EXAMPLE VALUE:{/b} {i}See All that Life has to Offer{/i}\n\nAn oddity for humanoid species, the Ocampa are an\nextremely short-lived people whose lifespan rarely\nexceeds a decade. For nearly all of Ocampan history, they\nhave been under the protective watch of the Caretaker\n– a member of an extremely powerful extra-galactic\ncivilization. At some point in the distant past, the Caretaker\nwas responsible for rendering the Ocampan homeworld\nnearly uninhabitable. To attempt to atone for this act, the\nCaretaker then spent the following centuries ensuring the\nOcampan people had everything they could need. This\nrelationship continued until the Caretaker’s death – and\nas a final act, the powerful being provided the Ocampans\nwith sufficient energy reserves to hold out for another half\ndecade at best.\n\nWhile, physically, they are nearly identical to Humans,\nOcampan physiology is radically different. The Ocampa\nonly live to be roughly ten standard years old – though this\ncan be extended significantly through advanced medical\ntechnologies. Much like insects, Ocampa development\nproceeds through a series of stages – alternating periods\nof stability and rapid aging. New-born Ocampans remain\nin a childlike stage for a brief year before rapidly aging\nand growing into pseudo-adulthood. Following this, they\nremain in this stage for another few years before reaching\nsexual maturity, a stage that lasts only a few months before\nfading. After this, Ocampans gradually continue to age\nthrough their adulthood before undergoing one final rapid\ndevelopment stage that marks their twilight. Once this\noccurs, Ocampa can expect to live for no more than a year\nor two before expiring.\n\nInterestingly, Ocampa possess powerful, latent telepathic\nabilities that appear to have become long since dormant.\n\nIf allowed, or nurtured, into development, these abilities\nrange from simply forms of empathy and telepathy, to more\npowerful and advanced forms of precognition and even\ntelekinesis. The full range and capability of these talents has\nyet to be fully determined." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

Members of this\nspecies have remained the champions of this interplanetary\ncompetition due to their physical size and tenacity. The\nPendari see this as a political and propaganda victory, and\nit propels their homeworld into a position of prominence.\n\nPendari fighters are known for their immense physical\nstature and equally ill-tempered demeanor. This makes them\nincredibly effective combatants.\n\nPolitically, the Pendari represent a minor power in their region\nof space, though they maintain excellent relations with many\nof the neighboring systems. These cultural alliances ensure\nthat the Pendari have known extended periods of peace,\nand their feared warriors test themselves in the arena instead\nof the battlefield.

Warm and\nwelcoming, the Sikarians are renowned through the region\nas one of the most hospitable civilizations, and deeply enjoy\nguests and visitors to their world. Despite their advanced\ncapabilities, the Sikarians do not claim a large domain and\ninstead can be found on a handful of colonies outside of their\nhomeworld. While they maintain a small, yet powerful, fleet,\nthey primarily rely on their advanced transporter technology,\ncalled a trajectory, to travel between destinations.\n\nSimilar to the Federation, the Sikarians maintain strict rules\nregarding the sharing of technology and non-interference\nwith other cultures. While this has served to cause some\namount of friction between the Sikarians and their neighbors,\ntechnology like the spatial trajector relies exclusively on the\nunique characteristics of their homeworld and simply will not\nfunction elsewhere. Despite this, the Sikarians are a generous\npeople, and will openly provide aid to those in need – so\nlong as such aid remains within the provisions of the Sikarian\nCanon – the name given to Sikarian law.\n\nThe Sikarians are avid storytellers, and relish hearing stories,\nanecdotes, and myths from other cultures. In fact, many\nSikarians enjoy and desire cultural expression – especially\nliterature – to the point of near hedonism.

Talaxians have been warp capable for millennia,\nand during this time they have encountered countless\nspecies and traveled to nearly all corners of the quadrant.\n\nTalaxians have a reputation for being sociable, good natured\ntravelers who enjoy the company of others. Unlike other\nspecies that have been warp capable for such an extended\ntime, Talaxians are not known for their technological\ncapabilities – which can vary wildly from group to group.\n\nLike many species in the quadrant, Talaxians do not boast a\nsignificant military presence or large empire, though this may\nbe due to the war between them and the Haakonian Order\n– a conflict that left both sides exhausted. Unfortunately, the\nwar ended with the surrender of the Talaxian government\nfollowing the detonation of a weapon of mass destruction on\na Talaxian moon.\n\nThe trauma suffered by the Talaxian people during the war\nresulted in a large number of Talaxian refugees seeking\nsafety beyond Talaxian space. Further, most Talaxians\nseek to avoid confrontation if possible and may even flee\nfrom a determined foe. The Talaxians are not, however,\ncowardly by nature, and when left with no alternative they\ncan display great levels of courage and heroism. This\navoidance of physical confrontation does not, however,\nspill over into their social dealings, as Talaxians are rarely\nfearful of speaking their mind when offended or upset.\n\nTalaxians enjoy good food and good company, and many\nconsider themselves superb culinary experts – though their\nassociates may argue otherwise." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

Today, the Turei are an insular culture and protect the\nUnderspace, and therefore their livelihood, with aggressiveness and determination. Their control of\nUnderspace has provided them with prosperity and military supremacy on all worlds that connect to it\nand they jealously guard it.
