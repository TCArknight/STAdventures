Their global leader and religious icon, Iryax Nedaon, actively encourages technological development oriented toward space travel and stellar exploration, and regional universities have increased the number of degree programs in related fields of study.\n\nWhile a population of 1.3 billion generally should not be described by one word, a common note through all Akaru society is that of efficiency. Their cities, vessels, farms, and processes are all designed toward maximizing resources, space, and personnel. That dedication to communal efficiency permeates Akaru relationships as well, sometimes to a given relationship’s potential detriment.

An Orion will be warm and welcoming to newcomers and be open to talking about a variety of topics as they get to know them. Too often this is a ruse, as Orion culture is based around seizing the advantage in all things and working out the best deals to benefit their society. Though they proudly claim to be strictly neutral in the affairs of the galaxy, the Orions are the founders of two organizations that have profoundly impacted Starfleet and other empires: the Orion Trade Union and the Orion Syndicate. Too often Orions are members of both of these organizations and the species they interact with will learn too late which group they are dealing with. Though the Orion Syndicate is a menace that is the target of dozens of law enforcement agencies, their persuasive negotiating skills and extensive criminal empire have guaranteed their continued existence.\n\nOrion society is broken down along binary gender lines. Orion females are typically the leaders of Orion society, and have evolved an advantage where their bodies secrete special pheromones that cause a hypnotic effect in males of some species. Orion males were second-class citizens for centuries and only recently gained full recognition in Orion society, though they are still most commonly seen as laborers and crew on Orion outposts and vessels. When it comes to the Syndicate, Orions prefer to let members of other species work for them; this not only guarantees that the Orion can continue their claim of strict neutrality, but they also avoid the risk of fallout from their criminal enterprises.\n\n{i}{b}Example Value:{/b} Everything is a Deal{/I}" compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">
