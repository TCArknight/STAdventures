They are predatory, with a primarily carnivorous diet, and a preference for either still-living food or wild prey from a hunt. Culturally, Klingons revere physical prowess, victory in battle, and a code of personal and familial honor that influences most of their politics, though not all Klingons live up to this; in some Klingons, this only keeps them from performing shameful acts so long as they can avoid the repercussions." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">
