  <thing id="trRomulan" name="Romulan" description="Romulan physiology is not meaningfully different to that of Vulcans, though a portion of the Romulan species exhibits a v-shaped forehead ridge not evident in Vulcans.  The largest difference is that Romulans lack the intense mental discipline common to Vulcans. Psychologically and culturally, Romulans prize cunning and strength of will, and are distrustful of other species: this opinion is reciprocated, as Romulans have a reputation for manipulation, deception, and betrayal." compset="Trait">

Rather, Romulans are a cruel and ruthless people, quick to anger, and easily moved to emotion.\n\nA culture of military discipline seems to keep their worst members directed towards useful ends, though paranoia and self-interest motivate Romulan politics as much as a desire for collective benefit; at times, it seems that the only things keeping the Romulan Star Empire together are the fact that they despise other species more than they despise one another.\n\n{i}EXAMPLE VALUE: {/i}\n\n{b}ATTRIBUTES:{/b} +1 Control, +1 Fitness, +1 Reason.\n\n{b}TRAIT:{/b} Romulan." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

As of 2371, only a single individual has ever been removed from the Borg Collective — Jean-Luc Picard, who was captured only days earlier, meaning that his implants were less extensive than those of someone assimilated years or decades before.
