Their blue skin, pale hair, and antennae give them a distinctive appearance, and while the Andorian Imperial Guard was demobilized when the Federation was founded, they still maintain strong military traditions, and a tradition of ritualized honor-duels known as Ushaan, using razorsharp ice-mining tools.\n\nAndorians have developed powerful traditions of ritual, convention, and personal honor to help direct their intensity and energy towards constructive ends.\n\n{i}EXAMPLE CHARACTERS: Thy’lek Shran (Enterprise), Jennifer Sh’reyan (Lower Decks), Ryn (Discovery){/i}" compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

Many Bajorans were scattered across the Alpha Quadrant during the occupation, while those who remained on Bajor often acted as insurgents or toiled in labor camps under Cardassian rule. The occupation ended a few years ago, but the scars it left will take generations to heal. Bajor is not a member of the Federation, but many Bajorans scattered by the diaspora have found their way into Starfleet. Bajoran culture places a strong belief in the Prophets, celestial beings who are said to have watched over Bajor for millennia; modern religious doctrinestates that the Bajoran Wormhole is the Prophets’ Celestial Temple.\n\nBajoran spirituality has long been a powerful factor in their lives, even for Bajorans who did not believe strongly in the Prophets. The unifying presence of their religion provided a source of hope and courage. A common sign of this faith is the D’ja pagh, a symbolic earring.\n\n{i}EXAMPLE CHARACTERS: Kira Nerys (Deep Space Nine), Lt. Shaxs (Lower Decks)\n{/i}" compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

The world has long been a valued member of the Federation, and its people can be found across Federation space, including Starfleet. Betazoids appear almost identical to Humans but differ in one major way: they are naturally telepathic, developing mental abilities during adolescence. The potency of this ability varies between individuals.\n\nDue to their widespread telepathy, Betazoids have a culture of honesty and directness—there is little reason to be evasive or deceitful in a culture where everyone can read your mind and sense your emotions. Among non-telepaths, and even telepaths of other species, this can result in some Betazoids seeming blunt or even rude. Betazoids who spend a lot of time among other cultures tend to either lean into this notion or choose to temper their honesty with tact.\n\n{i}EXAMPLE CHARACTERS: Deanna Troi (The Next Generation), Lon Suder (Voyager)\n{/i}" compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

Denobulans are long-lived and highly sociable, with large families—Denobulans are typically polyamorous, with individuals potentially having several spouses, each of whom may have several spouses of their own, and dozens of children between them—living in relatively close, communal environments. Culturally, Denobulans are an intellectually curious people, highly perceptive, and interested in a wide range of philosophies, with their long lives allowing them to pursue a wide range of fields of study, often granting them unusual perspectives on the different philosophies and fields of expertise they’ve studied.\n\nDenobulans enjoy learning new things, meeting new people, and they revel in the drama, intrigue, and gossip that come from a rich and complex social environment. They are extraordinarily patient, taking a long view of the changes that happen in life, but they dislike solitude, and even a busy starship or starbase can sometimes seem a little empty to a Denobulan.\n\n{i}EXAMPLE CHARACTERS: Phlox (Enterprise)\n{/i}" compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

Earth is a founder and pivotal member of the United Federation of Planets, and many of the Federation’s institutions can be found on Earth. Humans often exhibit a dichotomy in their nature — being both driven to strong emotion and careful reason — and while they have largely grown beyond their warlike and divisive past, their drive and capacity for aggression are as much a part of their success as their curiosity and analytical minds.\n\nHumans tend to draw upon two sets of cultural values. As a central and founding member of the Federation, the traditions and ideals of the Federation (or even those of Starfleet) are often regarded as synonymous with “Human culture” (though the Federation draws a lot from each of its members), to the point where nobody is entirely sure where Earth ends and the Federation begins. Yet, conversely, this can also lead to Humans finding value in preserving the traditions and cultures of their pre-warp ancestors.\n\n{i}EXAMPLE CHARACTERS: Ben Sisko (Deep Space Nine), Kathryn Janeway (Voyager)\n{/i}" compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

Their bodies are thick-set and covered in dense hair, and they stand a little shorter than Humans on average. Many male Tellarites possess tusks to some degree, though they vary in size and prominence.\n\nTellarites are known to be highly argumentative, even rude by the standards of other cultures, often complaining frequently or insulting others as part of social interactions. In truth, this comes from a sense of intellectual honesty and rigorous skepticism. To a Tellarite, no idea, concept or person is beyond challenge or analysis, and any notion that cannot stand up to scrutiny is an unworthy one. Tellarites revel in debates, and enjoy arguing, and the criticisms, complaints, and insults issued during conversations are intended to be met in kind: to do otherwise is to display a weak character, an inability to stand up for oneself, or an unwillingness to confront one’s own flaws.\n\n{i}EXAMPLE CHARACTERS: Jankom Pog (Prodigy), Zus Tlaggul (Strange New Worlds)\n{/i}" compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

The Trill that most outsiders know appear almost identical to Humans or Betazoids, but for a row of irregular spots running down the sides of their bodies. The other Trill species are small invertebrates, which dwell in subterranean caverns. There are relatively few of this second species, species, but they are extremely intelligent and capable of living for centuries.\n\nWhile not a secret, it is not widely discussed that a small portion of humanoid Trill are capable of bonding with the invertebrates, commonly referred to as symbionts, and in this bond—called a Joining—creates a gestalt person, a combination of the minds, memories, and personalities of both creatures. While a symbiont cannot be removed without killing its host, upon a host’s death, a symbiont will be passed to a new host, preserving knowledge and memory over generations.\n\nTrill society has been shaped by the Joined, with Trill culture tending to take a long view of social development, and pursuing intellectual and philosophical development over interpersonal conflict. The Trill are a firm anddedicated member of the Federation.\n\n{i}EXAMPLE CHARACTERS: Jadzia Dax (Deep Space Nine), Gray Tal (Discovery)\n{/i}" compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

Widely claimed to be emotionless, Vulcans in fact feel emotions deeply and intensely, to their own detriment. Ancient Vulcans were prone to murderous rage and fits of paranoia, and nearly destroyed themselves millennia ago, before Surak taught logic and the purging of emotion. His teachings led to peace among the Vulcans and the establishment of a culture driven by reason.\n\nVulcans embrace science and logic, but their lives are not purely devoted to such things: they have a deeply philosophical and spiritual side, with art and music as vital to their culture as logic. They are also an intensely private people, with many aspects of their culture largely kept secret from outsiders.\n\n{i}EXAMPLE CHARACTERS: Spock (Star Trek), T’Pol (Enterprise), Tuvok (Voyager)\n{/i}" compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

They are no less proud of their heritage, but they express that pride differently, often taking great pride in their skills and the work they do.

  <thing id="spc2EMixedHer" name="Mixed Heritage" description="Many Starfleet officers have parents from different species. To create mixed-heritage characters, choose two species (one for each parent), and then select one of those two as the primary species—the species which the character takes after the most. Characters may have more than two species, if one (or both) of their parents are mixed heritage, but in game terms, select only the two most prominent species of all of those the character is descended from.\n\nThe character is treated as a member of the primary species for attribute bonuses and their Species Ability. The character gains the species traits of both parent species and counts as a member of both species for the purposes of talent requirements. The gamemaster may rule on any game mechanics that may conflict: for example, a part-Andorian, part-Aenar character might not be blind, but their other senses may not be as heightened." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

Due to a dearth of natural resources and an economic collapse, Cardassian culture was overtaken by an oppressive authoritarian regime dominated by the military, which began a decades-long campaign of expansion, conquest, and exploitation, including the occupation of Bajor and a lengthy border conflict with the Federation. In the aftermath of the Dominion War, with the military government overthrown, the rebuilding of Cardassia was a difficult process, not least because of long-held feelings of resentment towards the Cardassians.\n\nCardassians are a creative, dedicated people, with a strong cultural fascination with intrigue. Cardassians are inclined to keep secrets, and to regard suspicion as wisdom, and the uncovering of secrets is regarded as a valuable skill.\n\n{i}EXAMPLE CHARACTERS: Elim Garak (Deep Space Nine), Seska (Voyager)\n{/i}" compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

Their culture promotes the accumulation of material wealth, and their society is capitalistic, with most routine activities accompanied by an exchange of money, typically in the form of gold-pressed latinum (a non-replicable liquid metal, suspended within “slips,” “strips,” “bars,” and “bricks” of gold). Ferengi society is strongly patriarchal, with female Ferengi traditionally disallowed from owning property or even wearing clothing (and male Ferengi often having deeply unpleasant attitudes towards non-Ferengi women), though these attitudes start to change by the late 24th century.\n\nFerengi pride themselves on their ability to acquire wealth, though there are many different approaches to this. For centuries, Ferengi culture has been dominated by the philosophies and lessons of the Rules of Acquisition, though these can be interpreted in a variety of different ways and applied to a Ferengi’s life.\n\n{i}EXAMPLE CHARACTERS: Quark (Deep Space Nine), Nog (Deep Space Nine)\n{/i}" compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

This seems to be at least partially by design. Orions are accustomed to taking full advantage of any opportunity that passes their way, and the uncertainty and misdirection that surrounds them is a considerable advantage. The influence of Orion traders and the Orion Syndicate can be felt across the Alpha and Beta Quadrants, often in ways that flout the laws of other cultures, and often employing agents of other species.\n\nOrion culture appears to be divided along gender lines, and there is evidence to suggest they have a broadly matriarchal culture, with the women serving in leadership roles, while Orion males more often serving as muscle, laborers, and minor operatives, though this has shifted somewhat over the centuries. This appears to be due to a trait of some Orion females, who have been observed to produce pheromones that can make male Orions (and males of some other species, including Humans) compliant. It isn’t known how widespread this trait is.\n\n{i}EXAMPLE CHARACTERS: D’Vana Tendi (Lower Decks), Osyraa (Discovery)\n{/i}" compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

These Vulcans, “those who marched beneath the Raptor’s wings,” refused to accept the teachings of Surak, and thus did not embrace logic or stoicism, and eventually their ships would reach the worlds known as Romulus and Remus. Much of what is known about the Romulans has been pieced together from secondary and tertiary sources, as the Romulans themselves are secretive bordering on paranoia and do not disclose any information about themselves unless they deem it vital. Indeed, the Federation didn’t even know what Romulans looked like until a century after the Earth-Romulan War.\n\nTo the Romulans, trust is something to be placed in only a few, for misplaced trust can be a deadly weapon. A Romulan trusts only their closest family members, and places increasing layers of secrecy, obfuscation, and misdirection as relationships grow more distant. There are exceptions to this, such as the scrupulously candid order Qowat Milat, but most Romulans are highly guardedand suspicious of everyone.\n\n{i}EXAMPLE CHARACTERS: Elnor (Picard), T’Rul (Deep Space Nine)\n{/i}" compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

While genetics as a science is not expressly outlawed, genetic engineering of sapient life-forms is approached with caution and heavily regulated.\n\nIn the more lawless regions of space, less scrupulous genetic engineers pursue their craft free from what they see as persecution, but the unrestricted nature of their work often results in unforeseen side-effects, with unrestricted tampering of the genome often resulting in mental, emotional, or physical impairments, mutated diseases, or other problems." compset="Trait">
