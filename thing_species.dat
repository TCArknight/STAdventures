  <thing id="spcBajor" name="Bajoran" description="A spiritual, dauntless people from the planet Bajor, the Bajorans have lost much after decades of occupation by the Cardassian Union. Many Bajorans were scattered across the Alpha Quadrant during the occupation, while those who remained on Bajor often acted as insurgents or toiled in labor camps under Cardassian rule. The occupation ended a few years ago, but the scars it left will take generations to heal. Bajor is not a member of the Federation, but many Bajorans scattered by the diaspora have found their way into Starfleet. Bajoran culture places a strong belief in the Prophets, celestial beings who are said to have watched over Bajor for millennia; modern religious doctrinestates that the Bajoran Wormhole is the Prophets’ Celestial Temple.\n\n{i}EXAMPLE VALUE: Faith in the Prophets{/i}\n\n{b}ATTRIBUTES:{/b} +1 Control, +1 Daring, +1 Insight.\n\n{b}TRAIT:{/b} Bajoran." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

Denobulans are a sociable people, with distinctive expressive features, who are used to living in close, communal conditions, and whose extended family groups are large and complex — a Denobulan may have several spouses, each of whom may have several partners of their own, and dozens of children between them.

Earth is a founder and pivotal member of the United Federation of Planets, and many of the Federation’s institutions can be found on Earth.

Theirs is a culture noted for being abrasive and argumentative, with a stubborn pride, quick tempers, and little patience. However, this is only a superficial view: while Tellarites are argumentative, it comes from a sense of intellectual honesty and rigorous skepticism. To a Tellarite, no idea, concept, or person is beyond challenge or analysis, and any notion that cannot stand up to scrutiny is an unworthy one. Tellarites revel in debates, and tend to greet one another with criticisms, complaints, and even insults; failing to respond in kind is poorly-regarded, as it displays a weakness of character and an unwillingness to confront flaws.\n\n{i}EXAMPLE VALUE: All Ideas must Withstand Scrutiny{/i}\n\n{b}ATTRIBUTES:{/b} +1 Control, +1 Fitness, +1 Insight.\n\n{b}TRAIT:{/b} Tellarite." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="spcTrill" name="Trill" description="The Trill species, from their homeworld of the same name, appear almost identical to Humans, but for rows of spots running down the sides of their bodies, from head to toe. However, this superficial similarity conceals a considerable difference — the Trill are capable of bonding with a symbiotic organism known as a symbiont, creating a distinct being from the two individual creatures. The symbionts can live for many centuries, and are placed with successive hosts, carrying the memories and knowledge of previous hosts into a new joining with each new generation. This fact isn’t widely known outside the Trill themselves, but it isn’t a secret — it simply isn’t widely discussed, and the number of joined Trill is relatively small. The Trill have been part of the Federation for well over a century, with several renowned Trill serving important roles in shaping the Federation. The Trill, as a culture, tend to be focused on intellectual pursuits first and foremost, as learning and wisdom are prized by the symbionts in their hosts.\n\n{i}EXAMPLE VALUE: Four Lifetimes of Adventure{/i}\n{b}ATTRIBUTES:{/b} +1 Control, +1 Presence, +1 Reason.\n\n{b}TRAIT:{/b} Trill." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

Vulcans embrace science and reason, but their lives are not purely devoted to logic: they also have a deeply philosophical side, with art and music as vital to their culture as logic. They are also an intensely private people, with many aspects of their culture — such as the rites of pon farr — which are not discussed amongst outsiders.\n\n{i}EXAMPLE VALUES: The Needs of the Many Outweigh the Needs of the Few, or the One.{/i}\n{b}ATTRIBUTES:{/b} +1 Control, +1 Fitness, +1 Reason.\n\n{b}TRAIT:{/b} Vulcan." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">
