  <thing id="trAnkari" name="Ankari" description="Ankari are reptilian humanoids and possess many of the{br}biological attributes common to those species. Their skin is coarse and thick,{br}with light to dark brown coloring. Like most reptilian species, the Ankari do not{br}possess body hair – though they do have soft spines that run along the back of{br}their skulls. These, along with their brows, provide the Ankari with the ability to{br}detect faint vibrations and act as a form of sixth sense. Their native, harmonic{br}language likely developed due to this additional sense" compset="Trait">

Most are trained{br}in this area of expertise professionally, and while Jye are capable of{br}physical feats similar to those of Humans, they are not known for their{br}physical attributes. Jye originate from a frigid Class-M planet at the very{br}far edge of its star’s habitable zone. It is a world of dim solar light and cold,{br}relentless winters, and the Jye have evolved with a resistance to the cold.{br}{br}Conversely, the Jye struggle more than other humanoids in hot temperatures." compset="Trait">

  <thing id="trLiberatedBorg" name="Liberated Borg" description="As they come from so many different species, Liberated Borg have little physically in common with each other. They retain some of the cybernetic implants common to Borg drones, as not all of theses can be safely removed. Their original traits slowly begin to reassert their influence the longer the drone remains free from the collective. Borg are highly resistant to natural diseases, but are weak to electric shocks and exotic radiation. Those with the right implants can survive vacuum and other harsh environments, though they may still be susceptible to influence from the collective, and failing implants can be hazardous to a Liberated Borgs health. The Liberated Borg do not sleep conventionally, requiring routine access to a Borg regeneration alcove." compset="Trait">

Their world{br}is a temperate one, with mild seasons and fair weather.{br}{br}Unfortunately, it is also lacking in natural resources –{br}{br}which forced the Lokirrim to mine deep into the planet’s{br}crust and eventually reach out into their solar system.{br}{br}While they may have used holograms to perform most{br}manual labor, the Lokirrim retained their physical stature{br}and endurance.

Physically they are nearly indistinguishable{br}from Humans and possess similar physical{br}characteristics. Their technological level is a century{br}or more behind the Federation, though their medical{br}techniques, especially those relating to the adjustment{br}of thought patterns, is significantly advanced. The Mari{br}homeworld is pleasantly temperate and, given their warm{br}nature, could easily be a vacation spot in the quadrant{br}– were it not for their justice system.

This theory is{br}supported by their physical appearance. Monean skin coloration and markings all{br}reflect an aquatic origin. As such, Moneans are capable swimmers and can hold their{br}breath for an extended period.

Unfortunately, individuals who retain their memories\noften have the most difficult time adjusting to their new life.\n\nFurther, Kobali characters will likely be confronted with the\nimplications of their resurrection – either from hostile species who object to the process, lost family members seeking reconnection, or from the Kobali wishing them to return to be with their new Kobali family." compset="Trait">
