  <thing id="eqChrono" name="Chronometer" description="The chronometer is a useful device that has far more functionality than a clock, as its name suggests. A chronometer records the passing of time in the universe outside of the immediate vicinity of the device. This is accomplished by monitoring hundreds of pulsars and standing gravity waves in subspace with accuracy down to nearly Planck-time scales. Comparison of a chronometer and a local ‘ships clock’ is what allows crews to monitor for relativistic effects and any strange occurrences in space-time. Hand-held chronometers allow for a more localized monitoring of spacetime in a smaller more humanoid sized space around the user rather than ship-mounted chronometers." compset="Equipment">
