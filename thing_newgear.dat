  <thing id="eqChrono" name="Chronometer" description="The chronometer is a useful device that has far more functionality than a clock, as its name suggests. A chronometer records the passing of time in the universe outside of the immediate vicinity of the device. This is accomplished by monitoring hundreds of pulsars and standing gravity waves in subspace with accuracy down to nearly Planck-time scales. Comparison of a chronometer and a local ‘ships clock’ is what allows crews to monitor for relativistic effects and any strange occurrences in space-time. Hand-held chronometers allow for a more localized monitoring of spacetime in a smaller more humanoid sized space around the user rather than ship-mounted chronometers." compset="Equipment">

The introduction of the monitor allowed doctors to collect information about the patient’s neurological condition in real time in everyday circumstances where certain symptoms may present more often. Use of the neurocortical monitor allows a patient undergoing observation to continue to perform normal duties, lack of this device means the patient must remain isolated in sick bay and unable to perform any normal ship functions." compset="Equipment">

In a natural gravity field the sled is less efficient, while on a vessel that has gravity plating, the sled interacts with the ships computer to lower the artificial gravity around the sled, allowing more mass to be moved and for a longer operational timespan.

This data usually consists of just a waveguide that allows starship sensors to detect the transmitter from light-years away when there is no interference, and from AU’s away with sub-space background scattering. While this does not allow for transporter systems to lock onto and beam a person using the transponder from distances or through material it normally wouldn’t (without the aid of pattern enhancers), it does allow for high accuracy in transports and acts as a SOS signal recognized by most governments across the Alpha and Beta quadrants. Characters using an emergency transponder gain the ability to show their position to any vessel currently using sub-space sensors within a radius determined by the GM, but usually very long distances measuring between a few hundred thousand kilometers and light-years." compset="Equipment">

The primary role of a PADD on a starship is to replace paper books, manuals, technical journals, and act as a personal scheduler and as an aid to complete administrative work.
