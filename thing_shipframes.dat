    <fieldval field="fraCapabilities" value="{i}Akira{/i}-class starships are considered cruisers by Starfleet Command, but unlike other cruisers in service, the {i}Akira{/i} doesn’t utilize a secondary hull. The vessel is designed to present the smallest sensor profile possible to augment the small surface area for its defensive shields. The highly-sloped surfaces of the outer hull were also augmented with ablative duranium armor plating, providing additional protection to C&amp;C systems and power distribution nodes. The {i}Akira{/i} wasn’t only designed with defensive measures in mind; the vessel contained more firepower for a ship of its displacement than any other vessel then in service. The saucer of the vessel was equipped with extensive Class XII phaser arrays capable of covering every angle of attack. The ship’s weapons pod, located between its large “pontoons” that were attached to the saucer and also mounted the vessel’s warp nacelles, contained the same phaser arrays and forward and aft firing photon torpedo systems. These same torpedo launchers were also serviced by magazines containing the vessel’s probe stores to augment the vessel when it was conducting survey and exploration assignments. The vessel’s quantum torpedo systems were dedicated solely to the new technology and were not serviced by the same probe magazines. The vessel was also designed with spacious shuttlebay flight decks and maintenance areas, allowing for the vessel to deploy runabouts, fighters, or shuttlecraft in a variety of mission profiles. "/>

Originally the photon torpedo systems were located inside the hull of the spaceframe, but necessity moved the launcher to a separate pod at the apex of a “roll-bar.” This made the launchers more difficult to repair, but also allowed the addition of aft-facing launch tubes to give the vessel a wider range of fire for the torpedoes. One holdover kept from the original design was the inclusion of two large shuttle and cargo bays at the aft of the spaceframe. Once meant to house armed shuttles or landing craft, these bays give this spaceframe an excellent reputation for performing rescue operations and conducting planetary surveys.

The design was not intended as a true warship, therefore, when the initial Khitomer Accords were signed in 2293, the class’ production wasn’t ceased, but its assignments were changed from being an alert interceptor to an emergency response vessel used to deal with crises that could rapidly spiral out of control without Starfleet’s intervention." compset="Frame" uniqueness="unique">
    <fieldval field="fraYearEnt" value="2285"/>
    <fieldval field="fraCapabilities" value="Until the deployment of the Constellation class, Starfleet had never commissioned a four-nacelle design for general use in the fleet. The intent for the potent combination of four warp nacelles and two separate impulse drive reactor arrays was to provide the craft with the ability to maintain high warp speeds by alternating the use of two nacelles at a time and then switching the active nacelles before the warp coils would overheat and normally require a starship to drop out of warp. While Constellation-class vessels were not the highest velocity craft at warp speeds, the maximum sustained cruising speed of the vessel was just over warp 8. All four nacelles could be used to increase warp acceleration or push the maximum velocity of the craft to over warp 9. At sublight speeds, the two impulse arrays would tax the class’s structural integrity field by accelerating from full stop to full impulse in less than five seconds, often surprising non-Federation crews by what was known as the ‘Constellation Sprint’. Another tactic developed on U.S.S. Stargazer NCC-2893 by then Lieutenant Commander Jean-Luc Picard became known as the ‘Picard Maneuver’ where the starship would accelerate and jump into warp and then drop back out to nearly full stop so the starship appeared to be in two places at once. This agility and speed lent itself to its re-designation as an emergency response vehicle. In addition, the vessels three large shuttle/fighter bays located along the edges of the saucer were redesigned for use in regular planetary shuttles or cargo shuttles. This made the Constellation class ideal for delivering large quantities of emergency supplies to vast areas of a planet’s surface, or transporting colonists to newly terraformed worlds. The usefulness of this design has been great enough that Starfleet has kept many of these vessels on active duty, continuing to use them as couriers and rapid response, refitting them with new developments in technology over its decades of service."/>

These computers had powerful subspace fields around them, allowing even faster processing time for the vessel’s highly integrated sensor networks. Even with the increase in tensions with the Cardassian Union and the Borg, design teams still limited the weapon emplacements on board to small phaser arrays and a single torpedo launcher. The {i}Nova{/i} class is a superb scientific research vessel, but at the expense of creature comforts, as there was little space left for recreational activities.

To accomplish this, designers had to make compromises in the design, electing for compact systems rather than the best available for Federation shuttles. The Type-10 shuttlecraft, also known as the {i}Chaffee{/i} class, ended up using technology that had been discarded for a century or more as refinements to the equipment made them small enough to be required for this design. Loved and hated in equal measures by crew serving aboard them, the Type-10 is only permanently assigned to {i}Defiant{/i} and some {i}Nova{/i}-class starships.\n\n{b}SPECIAL RULES:{/b}\nThe Type 10 is difficult to repair while in space.

Repairs made in a proper repair facility reduce in Difficulty by 1 instead." compset="Frame" uniqueness="unique">

    <fieldval field="fraCapabilities" value="The Type-10 can handle up to four crew (and double that number in emergencies), but typically only has a crew of two assigned for away missions. This interior space is surprising for such a small shuttle. The openness of the Type-10 is only made possible due to the shuttle&apos;s reliance on compact fusion reactors in its two engine pods for power. Without a bulky matter/ antimatter reactor, more of these small reactors, along with more capacitors allow the Type-10 to maintain a cruising speed of Warp 3 and a burst speed of Warp 5 that can be sustained for approximately thirty seconds. As the Type-10 is typically assigned to combat vessels or small and under-armed science vessels, it has three hard-mounted type-5 phaser strips, one on each engine pod and one on the nose of the shuttle. The Type-10 also has a hardpoint on its ventral surface that allows the mounting of a micro-torpedo launcher for a single-shot quantum torpedo. Crews often complained about how many systems were located outside on the engine pods. As EVA suits are not standard on the Type-10 due to their bulk, damage to propulsion systems and hull damage were very difficult to repair. This isn&apos;t typically an issue as reports of reactor damage to the Type-10 results in high-energy plasma burning through the entire engine pod, and damaging the hull, resulting in crews beaming to safety in the emergency transporter, and scuttling the shuttle rather than trying to salvage the radioactive scrap."/>

Crews quickly found a workaround to use both pairs when requiring long duration high-warp travel by dropping from warp and manually rerouting the warp plasma to the other nacelles, and then entering warp again. This would allow the other warp coils to slowly cool and stabilize the field. The result was a starship that could cruise indefinitely at warp six, and achieve brief sprints of warp 7.7.{br}{br}These vessels had forward- and aft-facing photon torpedo launchers with independent magazines.

Being used to the “jack-of-all-traits” aspect of most cruisers produced by the fleet yards since the formation of the Federation, a more specialized starship meant for support was underutilized for decades. This lack of use in most high-profile missions of the early 23rd century would doom the spaceframe to only a single block of production. Their presence nearby major starbases would allow their crews time to learn the ins and outs of their starships.

One significant design advancement used in this design before others was a link to the warp plasma system for the phaser cannons, allowing for a faster recharge of the cannons’ capacitors from its own reactors. While this EPS link was unable to power the cannons fully if the system’s reactors were offline, the increase in rate of fire was seen as a distinct advantage. Forward and aft torpedo systems rounded out the long-range capabilities of the {i}Hoover{/i} class.{br}{br}With a need for a wide range of support missions to be possible with the spaceframe, two large shuttlebays were included along the dorsal side of the primary hull. These shuttlebays could hold and maintain six shuttlecraft in ready-to-launch status, with storage for twelve more along with several work bees.

When acting as a single vessel, the four primary nacelles alternate and the small command nacelle acts as a warp field stabilizer, allowing a top speed of warp 9.99 for over 12 hours. Each section is outfitted with phaser arrays and photon torpedo launchers, giving the {i}Prometheus{/i} class far more firepower than other Starfleet designs. The redundant equipment needed for independent operations in each section means that space is at a premium inside the vessel and crew comforts are minimal, similar to a {i}Defiant-{/i}class starship.

The {i}Sojourner{/i}’s focus was on engineering and operational support. The {i}Yorktown{/i} was focused on exploration and scientific discovery. Each retained the core capabilities of the class but leaned into these fields as their mission profile suggested. The {i}Enterprise{/i}-F herself would receive the {i}Yorktown{/i} refit after taking heavy damage in the Battle at Midnight. "/>
