    <fieldval field="fraCap" value="Unlike most vessels of its mass, Akira-class starships do not have a separate engineering hull, rather the vessel is designed to be as compact as possible to aid in maintaining a strong defensive shield strength over its entire surface area. Other defensive measures included raised pontoon-like structures on either side of the saucer that contained secondary shield generators to help protect vital command and control systems as well as highly sensitive sensor networks for planetary survey and stellar cartography missions that could double as back-up targeting systems for the vessel’s weaponry. The Akira class was also designed with extensive shuttlebays and attached support and maintenance facilities capable of manufacturing shuttles from scratch with the right raw materials. Capable of deploying shuttles of any size, fighters, and even Danube class runabouts, the Akira class is superb at space supremacy in combat roles and extensive stellar system survey in peacetime. If the mission assignment requires it, the shuttle recovery and maintenance systems are replaceable with cargo compartments and extra bulk transporter systems or even extra personnel quarters and life support systems to allow the craft to perform rescue and recovery operations. The torpedo pod mounted between the two pontoons aft of the hull isn’t as easily replaceable as the shuttlebays in the main hull due to the complex power feeds and targeting system relays that feed up the connecting pylons to the pod. This hasn’t stopped ASDB from working on ideas that include making sub-classes of the vessel that would replace the weapons systems with a subspace scanning array equal in size and resolution to ones typically seen in fixed installations. The torpedo pod itself is a unique design in Starfleet vessels, with a series of tubes in a line capable of a nearly continuous barrage as the system staggers the fire of each tube. Each of the standard tubes can be loaded with a store of subspace buoys or sensor probes, but the quantum torpedo systems standard on each vessel are dedicated systems and unable to launch alternate munitions."/>

The design of the Miranda class began as a dual-purpose patrol and combat vessel designed specifically to counter Klingon designs, specifically recent refits of the D7 battle cruiser. A combined team of designers from Starfleet Tactical and the Starfleet Advanced Technologies Group began co-opting and adjusting technologies and systems from the upcoming Constitution class refit, producing a heavily armed attack vessel just as peace broke out between the Federation and the Empire in 2267. Production of six spaceframes occurred before further manufacturing was halted while a complete redesign was undertaken. In 2272, the Miranda development group had beaten the sword into a plowshare by redesigning nearly 70% of the internal volume of the starship, attempting to make the vessel into a science and survey ship. The result was a highly adaptable starship that continues to be in use nearly one hundred years since its introduction." compset="Frame" uniqueness="unique">

    <fieldval field="fraCap" value="The original design of the Miranda class{br}had nearly double the amount of weapon systems as the{br}Constitution class as well as two large shuttlebays at the{br}aft of the starship. Many of these weapons were removed,{br}leaving three phaser turrets each on the dorsal and ventral{br}sections and two phasers mounted near the vessels impulse{br}deck. A phaser turret on both the port and starboard ‘roll bar’ mountings was linked directly into the warp plasma{br}conduits, increasing the firepower significantly at risk of{br}depriving the starship of warp power at critical moments.{br}In addition, a modular torpedo system was installed at the{br}top of the vessels roll-bar, giving two forward and two rear{br}facing launch tubes that could be quickly replaced with{br}probe launchers. Some of the extra power requirements{br}for weapon systems came from the ships compact shape,{br}lacking a secondary hull, the Miranda could generate the{br}same defensive shielding power as a Constitution class,{br}but for only 70% of the power. The reduction in weapon{br}systems also allowed many of the targeting systems to be{br}replaced by more high-resolution long-range sensors suited{br}for exploration duties. The large shuttle and cargo bays gave{br}the starship an excellent reputation for performing highly{br}detailed planetary surveys, being used for emergency cargo{br}transportation, and a border patrol vessel. The adaptability{br}of the modular systems of the Miranda class made it{br}indispensable for assignments to frontier starbases where{br}it could change its modules, and thus what assignments{br}it could perform, with little layover time. This meant that a{br}single Miranda could be assigned to a starbase rather than{br}two or three specialized starships.

    <fieldval field="fraCap" value="Until the deployment of the Constellation class, Starfleet had never commissioned a four-nacelle design for general use in the fleet. The intent for the potent combination of four warp nacelles and two separate impulse drive reactor arrays was to provide the craft with the ability to maintain high warp speeds by alternating the use of two nacelles at a time and then switching the active nacelles before the warp coils would overheat and normally require a starship to drop out of warp. While Constellation-class vessels were not the highest velocity craft at warp speeds, the maximum sustained cruising speed of the vessel was just over warp 8. All four nacelles could be used to increase warp acceleration or push the maximum velocity of the craft to over warp 9. At sublight speeds, the two impulse arrays would tax the class’s structural integrity field by accelerating from full stop to full impulse in less than five seconds, often surprising non-Federation crews by what was known as the ‘Constellation Sprint’. Another tactic developed on U.S.S. Stargazer NCC-2893 by then Lieutenant Commander Jean-Luc Picard became known as the ‘Picard Maneuver’ where the starship would accelerate and jump into warp and then drop back out to nearly full stop so the starship appeared to be in two places at once. This agility and speed lent itself to its re-designation as an emergency response vehicle. In addition, the vessels three large shuttle/fighter bays located along the edges of the saucer were redesigned for use in regular planetary shuttles or cargo shuttles. This made the Constellation class ideal for delivering large quantities of emergency supplies to vast areas of a planet’s surface, or transporting colonists to newly terraformed worlds. The usefulness of this design has been great enough that Starfleet has kept many of these vessels on active duty, continuing to use them as couriers and rapid response, refitting them with new developments in technology over its decades of service."/>

    <fieldval field="fraCap" value="As an exploratory vessel, the Constitution{br}class needed the best computer systems available, and was{br}designed to use the newly developed duotronic computer{br}system created by Doctor Richard Daystrom in 2243. This{br}breakthrough in computing technology allowed the computer{br}of Constitution-class starships to develop a limited AI-like{br}personality that sometimes became too self-aware and would{br}argue or bicker with officers and crew instead of providing{br}information and analysis. The computer system was able to handle the input from as many sensors as was typically seen{br}on three starships of previous classes, giving Constitutionclass{br}vessels sensor resolution and accuracy unable to{br}be matched until the late 2290s. To aid in exploration, the{br}design had a large shuttlebay with four class-F shuttlecraft,{br}but in an emergency situation could host six. While the warp{br}propulsion systems were not highly advanced, they were{br}made to be rugged and easily repaired, with many vessels{br}warp coils operating at high subspace field densities for 7–8{br}times the recommended time for replacement. This resilience{br}allowed Constitution-class vessels to operate far above their{br}rated safety limits, with U.S.S. Enterprise achieving brief{br}speeds of warp 14.1 in 2268, a speed record that would{br}hold until the 24th century. The warp reactor itself made{br}highly efficient use of antimatter by cycling warp plasma{br}through networked reactor cylinders housed behind main{br}engineering.

Automation of critical{br}systems were not possible with the technology of the time,{br}and the Constitution class required over 400 crew members{br}for operation, with two-person teams crewing each of the{br}design’s six phaser banks and four-person teams crewing{br}each torpedo launcher. To save on the already high number{br}of crew on board, these teams were made up of crew from{br}the vessel’s scientific teams that would not typically be needed during combat operations. The success of the class meant that as further refinements to warp technology and computer systems became available, Constitution-class starships were often the first in line for refitting at shipyards across the Federation.

As it’s a deep-space{br}exploratory vessel, all Intrepid-class starships have an{br}impressive amount of tactical systems as standard, the{br}reasoning being that it would be operating far from any{br}other allied starships and may need to defend itself against{br}multiple attackers. The Intrepid class has thirteen type-10{br}phaser strips, an additional four type 8 phaser emitters, and{br}five torpedo launchers (two forward, two aft, and one ventral{br}launcher that is typically only loaded with probes). To further{br}planetary exploration, all Intrepid-class vessels are assigned{br}at least four type-6 or type-8 shuttlecraft in addition to the{br}class-specific aeroshuttle that is located on the ventral side{br}of the primary hull. For crew recreation, new high resolution{br}holo-emitters and integrated replicator systems made{br}holodecks power efficient and able to create permanent{br}matter in the simulation to prevent continual holo-emitter{br}use and degradation. These same holo-emitters are also{br}installed in the sickbay, allowing the new Emergency Medical{br}Hologram system (EMH) to assist medical personnel when{br}they require it."/>

  <thing id="fraNova" name="Nova Class" description="Starfleet Command and the Federation Science\nCouncil formed a committee in 2363 to discuss the state\nof Starfleet’s aging science and exploration vessels. While\nthe Galaxy class was considered a success, the amount\nof personnel and resources required to construct one of\nthe massive exploration cruisers was significant. The end\nconclusion of the committee was that Starfleet required a\nnew science and exploration vessel that was small, easy to\nmaintain, but had the best sensor and scientific equipment\npossible in a small spaceframe.

    <fieldval field="fraCap" value="The designers at Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards{br}(UPFY) had been devising various next-generation designs{br}for several years when work began on the Nova class. The{br}science vessel was approximately the same size as the NX{br}class from the 22nd century and had a similar amount of{br}crew, typically requiring around 80 crew, depending on the{br}assignment. Like many ships designed around this time,{br}the Nova class had an integrated secondary hull under its{br}wedge-like primary saucer, capitalizing on both the most{br}recent theories on warp field dynamics and the faster{br}manufacturing that this simpler cross-section would allow.{br}However, though many next-generation technologies were{br}in their infancy at the time, the designers chose to make{br}use of tried, tested, and established components instead,{br}continuing to use an isolinear processing system for both{br}its primary and secondary computer cores and forgoing the{br}use of variable geometry warp drive. The reasoning behind{br}this was that the newer systems were still too bulky for the{br}small vessel and tended to make simulated Nova designs{br}far too cramped for even a bare minimum of crew members.{br}Designers at UPFY nevertheless improved upon these basic{br}components by increasing the strength of the warp field{br}around both computer cores, improving the processing{br}speeds by nearly doubling the field strength around the FTL{br}elements. The warp coils needed for the starship were small,{br}and engineers were able to place gimbal and gyroscopic{br}control elements around each of the individual coils, giving{br}the Nova class an even greater ability to modify the geometry{br}of its warp field than any other starship of its mass at the cost{br}of maintaining a steep field gradient, i.e. a lower maximum{br}speed. To save space, UPFY engineers compressed the{br}impulse systems into a single unit along the vessels spine{br}and only installed forward facing torpedo systems. The{br}type 10 phaser strips were short, reducing weapon arcs but{br}giving the vessel more interior volume that could be utilized{br}by life support and sensor systems rather than EPS transfer{br}systems and heat exchangers. The small crew size and the{br}slow cruising speed of the Nova class mean that its primary{br}assignments are planetary survey and short to mid-range{br}exploration missions lasting no more than six months before{br}crews rotate to larger vessels or facilities.{br}{br}Since the launch of U.S.S. Nova in 2368, three Nova-class{br}vessels have been destroyed or are presumed destroyed{br}including Borealis, Equinox, and Zodiac. While the reason{br}for the loss of Equinox in early 2371 is not yet known, it is{br}thought to be due to a failure of the anti-matter containment{br}systems when attempting to enter warp while under heavy{br}sublight acceleration. This failure occurred in the other{br}two starships, both in 2371. UPFY engineers are currently{br}studying these failures to determine if there are any serious{br}flaws with the design itself; this may determine whether the{br}Nova class has a future within Starfleet."/>
