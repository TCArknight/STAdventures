The two castes that still hold sway over an Ardanian’s potential are the city-dwellers of the floating city, Stratos, and the surface dwelling Troglytes. While anatomically no different, for years the Troglytes suffered from conditions and mental difficulties that reduced their higher brain functions. This was due to exposure to the zenite mines where they labored and, once the Federation Bureau of Industrialization got involved, breathing apparatus was quickly made mandatory.\n\nIn contrast the beautiful City of Stratos, floating in the lower atmosphere of Ardana, is home to a people entirely devoted to art, government and culture." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="spcBenzite" name="Benzite" description="{b}ATTRIBUTES:{/b} +1 Control, +1 Insight, +1 Reason.\n\n{b}EXAMPLE VALUE:{/b} {i}Report Only What You Know {/i}\n\nBenzite physiology gives this species’ skin a hairless blue-to-green complexion. The Benzite skull has a thick protrusion that extends over the brow and nose, with two facial tendrils above the lip. Until 2370 Benzites in Starfleet had trouble breathing a standard nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere and relied on breathing apparatus. Their apparent change in condition, which allows the species to go without breathing aids, is rumored to be thanks to genetic engineering, though reports are unconfirmed. Highly meticulous, a Benzite Starfleet officer is a valuable resource when it comes to exploration and investigation." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

Identified by a cartilaginous ridge that extends down their head, vertically, down the center of the face to the chest, with skin color ranging from light blues, to dark greens and muted purples with darker banding across the head. They are predominantly bald, though some females are known to have hair on their heads. Bolian marriages have more than two partners, of both sexes, but procreation with other species isn’t all that common, given the Bolians’ incompatibility with others. Humans, in particular, have noted several side effects of inter-species relations, including nausea, fatigue, and inflammation." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

As a telepathic and empathic species, the Deltans rank themselves alongside the Vulcans and Betazoids as able to read and communicate via thoughts and feelings. Indeed, some Deltan genealogists have theorized Betazoids are a distant cousin species.\n\nWith some of the most potent pheromones the Federation has ever encountered, many other species find the Deltans very sexually appealing. The vast majority of Deltans in Starfleet, therefore, take an oath of celibacy, ensuring their sexuality is not a distraction to their colleagues. By all accounts this is a good thing, as the Deltan act of intimacy involves not only their bodies but also their telepathic minds, possibly endangering the mental health of other species." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

Their society is dedicated to oral teaching, most notably in the form of a musical language that all Efrosian children are taught in some form or another. They are also excellent navigators and are often sought out as helm and navigation officers, as well as translators thanks to being natural linguists and communications experts. While their cranial ridges bear some similarity to Klingon physiology (though less pronounced), a male’s hair is almost always white from birth while females exhibit darker colors. Males grow long moustaches and both male and female Efrosians grow their hair out down their backs." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

They are predatory, with a primarily carnivorous diet, and a preference for either still-living food or wild prey from a hunt. Culturally, Klingons revere physical prowess, victory in battle, and a code of personal and familial honor that influences most of their politics, though not all Klingons live up to this; in some Klingons, this only keeps them from performing shameful acts so long as they can avoid the repercussions." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

They are descendants of saber-toothed turtles and, though bipedal, they have retained their ancestral beaks, claws and hard shells. Chelons are androgynous and take on masculine or feminine societal roles at varying points in their lives, reproducing like most reptilians by laying eggs and fertilizing those eggs. Some traditionalists within Chelon society maintain a neutral gender, and refuse to take on male or female roles." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

A diligent and hard-working species, the Jelna were the first Rigellians to engage in space flight. Although they took to commerce and system-wide government quicker than the Chelon, the Jelna weren’t aggressive, and they made sure that of democratic representation for all Rigellian species on the Governing Board and the Rigellian Trade Commission. The humanoid Jelnas have four genders: two male and two female genders. Male and female exosexes contain an additional Z chromosome, and they outnumber the endosexes 2 to 1. Exosexes are the more resilient and physically adept members of the species, while endosexes are more comparable to the male and female sexes typically found in other humanoid species." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

It is now colloquially known throughout the Federation as a “pleasure planet.” It’s a wonder the Risians evolved into the ceremonial society they have today, with tradition and ceremony being central to Risa society. \n\nRisians have an honest and open attitude to sexuality, renowned throughout the Galaxy. Potential mates with a sexual appetite display ceremonial icons, called a {i}horga’hn{/i}, that invite partners to participate in the sexual rite {i}jamaharon{/i}." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

But with a relaxed pace comes an appreciation for logical thought and considered discussion. Since becoming members of the Federation, Xindi–Arboreals have worked in Starfleet and the Federation as mediators, counsellors, diplomats and administrators." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

Primates are talented engineers and are often fair, honest and trusted. The Xindi inclusion into the United Federation of Planets in 2311 enabled Xindi-Primates to enhance their learning, and find positions in design, architecture, engineering, along with research and development. They, more than most species to attend the Academy, find themselves in the command division upon graduation, given their adaptability and audaciousness." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

They’re also notably dishonest and impatient when it comes to dealing with other species, including other Xindi. It is rare for Reptilians to apply to Starfleet Academy, and rarer still for them to be accepted, as their temperament can lead to confrontations. Those Xindi-Reptilians who do join Starfleet rival the Klingons in martial prowess, Tellarites in aptitude for debate, and Zakdorn in tactical expertise." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">

They, and the Reptilians are responsible for the destruction of their original homeworld, after detonating vast explosions beneath several seismically active points. Their language is the most complex among the Xindi species with 67 different dialects of clicks and chirps that other species find hard to replicate.

This asset has enabled the Federation to streamline its defensive policy over the years, with Zakdorn officials overseeing training exercises and “war games” for Starfleet. Their personal confidence and conviction is often considered boasting and hubris, particularly given that no rival species has ever tested the Zakdorn military. Zakdorn strategists have, however, helped Starfleet and the Federation immeasurably since they joined in the early 24th Century." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">
