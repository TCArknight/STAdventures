Glenn and Discovery were converted by removing the outermost part of the saucer section and converting it into a rotating ring housing subspace coils; adding fusion reactors to power the coils; and installing heavy shield emitters to protect the crew in the inner ring and command section from the intense subspace field generated by the spore drive."/>
    <fieldval field="fraOverview" value="Designed and produced in secret, the Crossfield class was produced solely to test the theoretical “displacement-activated spore hub drive” developed by Doctors Paul Stamets and Justin Straal. The launch of U.S.S. Crossfield in 2255 was a success for starship research and development, but initial tests of the spore drive were unsuccessful. With the limited number of spaceframes produced and the loss of both Glenn and Discovery, only U.S.S. Crossfield was left in service, and further spaceframes had their production cancelled. The Crossfield continued in service with the Starfleet Corps of Engineers until a collision with a sizable piece of an asteroid rendered the vessel unsalvageable. It remained in use as a testbed for new technologies until it was broken up in 2290."/>
