  <thing id="trRigellianChelon" name="Rigellian Chelon" description="The Chelon species retains a lot of characteristics from its ancestral species, a type of saber-toothed turtle. They have beaks, and a strong (if clumsy) bite; some have trained to use this in close-quarters combat. During times of stress or physical combat they also emit a deadly toxin through their skin. This can be used with their claws so that the toxin reaches an opponent’s blood. They are skilled swimmers and prefer a warm, humid climate. They are also resistant to ultraviolet radiation and, to a lesser extent, other radioactivity. This is probably due to the shells that extend over much their bodies." compset="Trait" uniqueness="unique">
