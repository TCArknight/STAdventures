  <thing id="foAstronav" name="Astronavigation" description="The character is an expert at interpreting and studying star charts, and picking the best route through a region. Space is not an empty void, and astronavigation requires understanding of subspace fluctuations, gas density variations, cosmic background radiation, gravitational distortions caused by stars and singularities, and a bewildering variety of factors that can change journey times by days, weeks or even months." compset="Focus">

  <thing id="foEVA" name="Extra-Vehicular Activity" description="These characters have logged hundreds (possibly thousands) of hours in environmental suits and thruster suits. They can use and maintain all common, contemporary forms of environmental suit (with variable configurations depending on conditions). Familiar with moving, working, and even fighting in low-G and micro-gravity, the character never feels nauseous." compset="Focus">

    </thing>
  <thing id="foSmallCra" name="Small Craft" description="The character flies shuttles, runabouts, and fighters as if they were an extensions of their own body. These handle differently from starships and, while this doesn’t matter during routine flights, skill with small craft can be the difference between life and death in a crisis. Many small craft need only one or two flight crew, so this Focus cover operations, tactical Tasks, engineering problems, and the to-be-expected piloting and navigation." compset="Focus">

    </thing>
  <thing id="foStarPro" name="Starfleet Protocols" description="The character has an in-depth knowledge of Starfleet protocols, regulations, and procedures. This Focus gives the sort of legalistic knowledge useful in untangling tricky regulations in sticky situations." compset="Focus">
    <tag group="FocusCat" tag="Command"/>
    </thing>
  <thing id="foStarRec" name="Starship Recognition" description="The character has a broad knowledge of different classes and types of starship, and can recognize them by visual appearance, thermal and radiation emissions, and by a number of other indicators. This is not just useful trivia, as the character can spot deviations from an expected baseline and so is able to identify, for example, when a ship has been modified or is producing false signals." compset="Focus">
    <tag group="FocusCat" tag="Conn"/>
    </thing>
  <thing id="foHistory" name="History" description="The character is well-versed in history, with a broad overview or a specific fascination with a single era; one world or a culture’s history; or a type of history such as military history or the history of exploration. The past can have useful parallels to today, and can help when avoiding repeated mistakes. As with Cultural Studies, this Focus may be renamed to reflect the character’s knowledge: a character with a Focus of History may have a broad understanding of the past, while a character with 21st Century Earth History will know about events and people specific to that era." compset="Focus">

  <thing id="foArt" name="Art" description="The character is highly knowledgeable about art; how it reflects its culture; individual pieces and artist history; and theories and analyses of pieces’ meanings. They draw upon this knowledge when attempting to be inspiring, or persuasive, or trying to reach an audience. Effective where an audience is familiar with a work or style, some artistic sensibilities do not translate between species. This Focus could be renamed for specific art disciplines and specific cultures’ arts. Literature and performing arts, such as quoting epic poetry or Shakespeare (in English or Klingon), mark a character as cultured." compset="Focus">

  <thing id="foCultStu" name="Cultural Studies" description="The character has knowledge of many cultures. This is helpful when dealing with members of familiar cultures, or when explaining cultural nuances to someone unfamiliar with them. It may also be renamed to reflect a narrower, deeper study of a single or small number of related cultures. The Gamemaster should reward successful knowledge- or observation-related Tasks with in-depth information." compset="Focus">

  <thing id="foDebate" name="Debate" description="The character is skilled in debate and discussion, presenting ideas in a compelling, succinct manner, using all the tools of rhetoric and oration and is skilled at defending or dissecting ideas. This is appropriate for Tellarite characters (among others) who revel in argument and believe good ideas must withstand scrutiny." compset="Focus">
    <tag group="FocusCat" tag="Command"/>
    </thing>
  <thing id="foDecept" name="Deception" description="The character is a talented liar, and capable of spotting the same in others. Starfleet does not condone deception; it is a matter of pride that Starfleet officers do not lie. But even if officers are true to themselves and speak honestly when it counts, calculated deception is a necessary tactic. Of course, knowing how to lie is an important part of spotting when others might be lying." compset="Focus">

  <thing id="foDiplo" name="Diplomacy" description="The character is versed in diplomatic matters on the grand scale of international relations, alliances, treaties and agreements, and at a personal level to settle conflicts. Diplomatic characters understand how nations interact and they are expert in defusing tensions and de-escalating hostilities between groups by seeking common ground or mutual advantage. Characters with this Focus are suited to first contact missions and situations where arranging cooperation is essential." compset="Focus">

  <thing id="foGambling" name="Gambling" description="The character has a knack for evaluating odds and knowing which chances to take. They might be accustomed to games like poker, or the Ferengi dabo and tongo, where both luck and skill are needed. Not unheard of amongst Starfleet officers — weighing up a perilous situation is important as long as leaders take responsibility for the consequences — such characters may have the {i}Bold{/i} Talent (page 135 of the {b}Star Trek Adventures{/b} core rulebook) to reflect their willingness to take chances." compset="Focus">
    <tag group="FocusCat" tag="Command"/>
    </thing>
  <thing id="foInspire" name="Inspiration" description="The character is an inspiration to others, helping them overcome fears and doubts during a crisis. Even Starfleet officers, determined as they are, rely on inspiring leadership in difficult situations. An inspirational character can get the most from subordinates, reinvigorating the weary and rallying the demoralized. Inspiring characters are often vital where the stakes are high and success seems distant." compset="Focus">

    </thing>
  <thing id="foLaw" name="Law" description="The character has studied the Federation legal code, and laws of other cultures too, and is expert enough to provide counsel during trials, or pass judgement in criminal matters. Command officers should understand Federation law or Starfleet regulations, and may serve as advocates in court. Characters with this Focus know the law, understand of procedure and practice, and can give sound legal advice." compset="Focus">

    </thing>
  <thing id="foLbE" name="Lead By Example" description="The character excels at leading by doing, and ‘gets their hands dirty’. They do not sit back and delegate, and never give an order they would not follow. These are practical leaders unafraid to test their own skills and who expect subordinates to follow without hesitation. Characters with this Focus have moved to the command department from some other part of Starfleet, and are used to relying on their own skills rather than directing others." compset="Focus">
    <tag group="FocusCat" tag="Command"/>
    </thing>
  <thing id="foLinguist" name="Linguistics" description="The character has a broad knowledge of communication and fluency in several languages. Despite the universal translator people still study languages, partly in case of technical faults or encounters with unfamiliar cultures, and partly because language is an important expression of cultural and societal evolution. Early in Starfleet history, ships often carried linguists to expand the universal translator and help communicate with unfamiliar cultures." compset="Focus">
    <tag group="FocusCat" tag="Command"/>
    </thing>
  <thing id="foMentDisc" name="Mental Discipline" description="The character has learned to control their thoughts, emotions and even parts of their subconscious. Mental discipline is rare and needs considerable effort to learn, but it offers an invaluable defense against telepathic intrusion. It is a bulwark against fear, panic, and despair, aids the recall of details, and allows tasks to be done despite distractions like pain. Vulcans, particularly those who have undergone the ritual of {i}Kolinahr{/i}, are likely to have this Focus, but they are not the only ones. Cardassians are often trained in childhood giving them eidetic memories, and allowing them to attempt protection from telepaths." compset="Focus">
    <tag group="FocusCat" tag="Command"/>
    </thing>
  <thing id="foNegotia" name="Negotiation" description="The character is a deal-maker, finding mutual advantage — or the appearance of it — in all manner of social situations. Negotiation frequently involves trade or resource distribution, and those involved seek an outcome that both sides find acceptable. Building trust between parties can be a slow process best handled by a meticulous approach. Ferengi are notorious for their enthusiasm for negotiation, but also for their tendency to deceive others to get a better deal." compset="Focus">
    <tag group="FocusCat" tag="Command"/>
    </thing>
  <thing id="foPhilos" name="Philosophy" description="The character ponders the nature of knowledge, reality, existence, and semantics. This is a complex subject, with countless schools of thought and each culture contains numerous philosophies. This Focus may indicate that the character has studied many different schools of thought, or it may be renamed to indicate the character’s deep study of a single philosophy. For example, a character could study Vulcan Philosophy, considering the teachings of Surak, the principles of logic and emotional control. Philosophy applies to Tasks where a character tries to understand a problem, or needs to determine an approach to the problem. It may also apply during social conflicts when attempting to explain matters effectively." compset="Focus">

  <thing id="foPolitic" name="Politics" description="The character understands how societies are structured and run, and the ideologies that can influence them. This includes the Federation’s democratic values, but also theories behind other cultures and regimes. It covers internal dynamics that create laws that shape society. This Focus is most valuable when studying or discussing different forms of society and government, such as during debates over whether a course of action contravenes a society’s mores. Characters with an interest in politics often find themselves supporting an admiral (or promoted to admiral themselves), where understanding the political landscape is a useful survival skill." compset="Focus">

    </thing>
  <thing id="foStratTac" name="Strategy/Tactics" description="The character is a skilled in deploying ships and soldiers, and in coordinating the application of force from many sources. They have an appreciation of past tacticians and strategists, and have studied significant battles. They may also have a talent for games of strategy, such as chess or Stratagema. This Focus is useful when creating Advantages related to a battle plan or maneuver, or when giving bonuses in combat. Characters often have a high Security Discipline, but not always: excellent strategists do not always need personal combat skills." compset="Focus">

  <thing id="foTeach" name="Teaching" description="The character is a capable instructor, providing guidance and knowledge to others. Characters bestsuited to teaching related to other Focuses, but they can teach anything they know to others. Teaching is especially suitable as a Focus for Tasks that provide assistance to allies, and characters with a Teaching Focus are suited to Talents that give them further benefits when offering aid." compset="Focus">
    <tag group="FocusCat" tag="Command"/>
    </thing>
  <thing id="foTeamDyn" name="Team Dynamics" description="The character has a deep understanding of how groups interact and how best to gain the best results through cooperation. This applies to small teams, rather than a starship’s entire crew, as not all team dynamics scale easily. This Focus can activate when laying out a plan for a group working on a complex project (which could be a Challenge or Extended Task), or when assisting or providing a bonus on Tasks towards a group effort." compset="Focus">
    <tag group="FocusCat" tag="Command"/>
    </thing>
  <thing id="foAtmoFli" name="Atmospheric Flight" description="The character excels at operating aircraft and small spacecraft in an atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure, air resistance, wind speed and gravity make atmospheric flight different to spaceflight, and understanding those differences can have a considerable impact when flying in rough conditions. Anyone trained to fly a shuttlecraft has basic atmospheric flight training, but to Focus in this field allows a pilot to brave a storm, or out-fly a pursuer, inside an atmosphere." compset="Focus">
    <tag group="FocusCat" tag="Conn"/>
    </thing>
  <thing id="foCombMane" name="Combat Maneuvers" description="The character has special training for flying in battle. This involves evading enemy fire, moving to maximize the tactical officer’s chances of hitting a target, moving as part of combat formations, and navigating crowded and chaotic battles. Combat maneuvers depend on the size and agility of a ship. Massive vessels like Galaxy-class starships are fast, but their size means that they’re used to shield smaller vessels, or to anchor a battle line, rather than to fly a precise course through the heart of the enemy line." compset="Focus">
    <tag group="FocusCat" tag="Conn"/>
    </thing>
  <thing id="foEvasive" name="Evasive Action" description="A character skilled in evasive actions keeps the ship safe and intact. Quick reflexes, sound judgement, and an instinct for maneuvering allow threats to be countered as they emerge. In battle this is invaluable, but it is also useful avoiding unknown conditions during space exploration." compset="Focus">
    <tag group="FocusCat" tag="Conn"/>
    </thing>
  <thing id="foGroundV" name="Ground Vehicles" description="While ground vehicles are not commonplace thanks to transporters and simple aircraft, the character can operate and maintain them. This expertise also includes the history of such vehicles, as many of them are historical objects in their own right. While this may seem irrelevant in Starfleet, some planetary conditions make ground transport a necessity, and a few exploratory and combat vessels produced all-terrain vehicles for use when needed." compset="Focus">
    <tag group="FocusCat" tag="Conn"/>
    </thing>
  <thing id="foHelmOps" name="Helm Operations" description="The character has a deep understanding of how a starship responds to inputs and commands, and can use that to get the best from the quirks and peculiarities of an individual ship. This includes learning response rates; the precise interactions of thrust, inertia and mass; ships clearances in turns; the time to reach a warp factor; and all the tiny details that separate triumph and tragedy. This Focus doesn’t cover small craft (see below); it is for general-purpose starship piloting." compset="Focus">
    <tag group="FocusCat" tag="Conn"/>
    </thing>
  <thing id="foImpEng" name="Impulse Engines" description="The character knows how to get the best from impulse engines and that a rudimentary plasma/fusion thrust system, combined with a low-intensity subspace field, amplifies the propulsive effect. This is used for most sub-light maneuvering, but not for fine maneuvers or anything approaching lightspeed. The character’s expertise covers flight at Impulse speed, and also gives understanding of the Impulse mechanisms, allowing maintenance and repairs." compset="Focus">
    <tag group="FocusCat" tag="Conn"/>
    </thing>
  <thing id="foSurvive" name="Survival" description="The character can use their knowledge of travel and navigation to help survival in the wilderness. Understanding how to navigate by the stars is not wildly dissimilar to understanding how find a way out of a forest or desert, if the character knows the environmental variables. With this training a pilot who can fly through nebulae and around black holes can use the principles to find a way through a wilderness." compset="Focus">
    <tag group="FocusCat" tag="Conn"/>
    </thing>
  <thing id="foWarpDrv" name="Warp Drive" description="The character has extensive knowledge of warp drives, the means of faster-than-light travel for all known Alpha and Beta Quadrant cultures including the Federation. This Focus covers warp drive from the pilot’s perspective: how a warp field configuration interacts with subspace variations, local gravity, and other spatial effects; and the trade-off between speed and power consumption for warp journeys. It also includes hands-on expertise so that the character can repair and maintain warp drives." compset="Focus">
    <tag group="FocusCat" tag="Conn"/>
    </thing>
  <thing id="foComposure" name="Composure" description="The character is good at remaining calm, useful where clear-headedness is needed. It is also vital when not revealing feelings or thoughts to an adversary by maintaining a ‘poker face’. Vulcans, for example, have the discipline and emotional suppression to remain impassive during traumatic situations." compset="Focus">
