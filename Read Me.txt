Ship Issues:
Resource Validation - shows Attributes and Disciplines instead of System and Department.
Resource Validation - number of Traits shouldn't be limited

Weapons - Phaser damage wrong, should be Scale + Security + Modifiers; seems to be just Scale + Modifiers.

Hero Issues:
Career Events - Missing many events.
Career Events - Needs Attribute and Discipline added to description.
Talents - Choosing Veteran correctly adds the Veteran Talent, but it doesn't add the fourth Talent to the list; says have used 4 of 3 Talents.
