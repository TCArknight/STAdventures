However, some environmental conditions, such as highly-ionized atmospheres, and electromagnetic fields, can have a severe effect. Further, Soong-type androids do not naturally have the capacity for emotions, requiring additional hardware to process and experience any feelings. The legal personhood of Soong-type androids is somewhat disputed, though a landmark case involving Lieutenant Commander Data establishes their right to self-determination." compset="Trait">

  <thing id="spcSngAnd" name="Soong-type Android" description="Originally designed by Dr. Noonian Soong the Soong-type Android is a exceptionally advanced artificial intelligence life-form. These android are capable of incredible feats of reason due to their positronic brain but are normally emotionless and may find it difficult to relate to organic beings. Certain advanced versions offset this problem by use of an emotion chip that allows them to experience a full gamut of emotions. Unfortunately it is possible for negative emotions like anger and megalomania to become dominant and cause the android to harm others.\n\n{i}EXAMPLE VALUE: If only I had a heart. {/i}\n\n{b}ATTRIBUTES:{/b} +1 Control, +1 Fitness, +1 Reason.\n\n{b}TRAIT:{/b} Soong-type Android." compset="Species" uniqueness="unique">
