After passing grueling entrance exams, you spent four years at the Academy, dividing your time between academic study, physical training, and gaining practical experience. Much of your time was spent at the main campus in San Francisco on Earth, but you probably also spent time at other facilities across the Federation, as well as aboard starships and starbases.\n\nA graduate of the Academy receives a commission as an officer of Starfleet, holding the rank of ensign, after which they are assigned to their first posting. Some cadets—particularly those pursuing a higher education, such as a doctorate—extend their time at the Academy by a year or two, and graduate at the rank of Lieutenant (junior grade).\n\nThe Academy provides different training depending upon a cadet’s aptitudes and desired role within Starfleet, referred to as track. When you select this option, choose (or roll on the Random Starfleet Division table) which Academy track the character pursues: Command, Operations, or Sciences." compset="CareerPath" uniqueness="unique">

Each year, a great many people enlist in Starfleet rather than joining the Academy. This is often the case for those who do not meet the requirements for the Academy, or who only wish to serve for a few years to gain some life experience.\n\nEnlisted crew receive basic training in starship procedures and protocols, as well as any specific courses required for their position, at the Starfleet Technical Services Academy on Mars, before being posted to a starship, starbase, or other facility.\n\nThe demand for these enlisted crew varies over time, with major recruitment drives occurring during times when Starfleet is expanding, or needs to replenish losses from disasters or times of conflict. Still, it’s a rare ship that has no enlisted personnel, typically within the Operations department, and experienced non-commissioned officers (NCOs) are highly prized for their practical knowledge and hard-won experience. A few NCOs obtain a commission later in their careers, becoming full officers.\n\n{b}EXAMPLE CHARACTERS:{/b} {i}Janice Rand (Star Trek), Miles O&apos;Brien (Deep Space Nine){i}\n\n{b}TRAIT:{/b} The character gains the trait Starfleet Crew.\n\n{b}VALUE:{b} The character gains a single value, which should reflect some aspect of the character’s beliefs that developed during their early years in Starfleet.

A lot of this work is passive, carried out as a natural part of Starfleet’s operations, by analysts and computer algorithms sifting through mission logs, sensor records, and similar data, but it cannot be done exclusively in this way.\n\nStarfleet Intelligence recruits operatives and assets across the Federation, and sometimes even beyond. Most established operatives are handlers and analysts, gathering information from a variety of sources and establishing their own networks of informants, who live ordinary lives and only occasionally pass on information. When Starfleet Intelligence needs to perform more significant actions, it often selects personnel from elsewhere in Starfleet to carry out the work. Many starbases and a few starships have an Intelligence officer on board, who serve as a point of contact for their commanding officers and spend much of their time gathering and summarizing information that may be of use to ongoing missions.\n\nOther civilizations in the Galaxy have comparable intelligence agencies, such as the Romulan Tal Shiar or the Cardassian Obsidian Order, both of which are infamous examples feared both within and beyond those civilizations.\n\n{b}EXAMPLE CHARACTERS:{/b} {i}Raffaela Musiker (Picard), Ro Laren (The Next Generation) {i}\n\n{b}TRAIT:{/b} The character gains the trait {b}Intelligence Operative{/b}.\n\n{b}VALUE:{b} The character gains a single value, which should reflect some aspect of the character’s beliefs that developed during their early years in Starfleet. \n\nExamples include:\n- Trust, but verify\n- Insufficient information can result in disaster\n- Secrets are my business\n\n{b}ATTRIBUTES:{/b} The character gains three points, which may be split between two or three attributes (increase three attributes by 1 each, or increase one by 2 and another by 1).
