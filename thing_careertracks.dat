  <thing id="ctTrkCommand" name="Command" description="The Command track is for those cadets who aspire to command their own starship someday. It focuses on leadership and interpersonal skills, diplomacy, decision-making in crisis situations, an understanding of protocol and procedure, and starship operations, which includes flight control. Many Command track cadets begin their careers as flight control officers and pilots, where their training can be put to the test on a smaller scale while they gain the experience necessary for more authority and responsibility. Command track cadets customarily undertake the infamous Kobayashi Maru test during their final year.\n\n{b}EXAMPLE CHARACTERS:{/b} {i}James T. Kirk (Star Trek), Kathryn Janeway (Voyager){i}\n\n{b}TRAIT:{/b} The character gains the trait Starfleet Crew.\n\n{b}VALUE:{b} The character gains a single value, which should reflect some aspect of the character’s beliefs that developed during their early years in Starfleet. Examples include:\n- Starfleet is a promise: I’d give my life for you, you’d give your life for me, and nobody gets left behind.\n- The first duty of every Starfleet officer is to the truth.\n- The Prime Directive is there to remind us that we are not gods, and should not act like them.\n\n{b}ATTRIBUTES:{/b} The character gains three points, which may be split between two or three attributes (increase three attributes by 1 each, or increase one by 2 and another by 1). The character may pick these attributes freely.\n\n{b}DEPARTMENTS:{/b} The player must select either Command or Conn as the character’s major—the subject they studied most intensely. This department is increased by 2. Then, the player selects two other departments—the character’s minor subjects—which are increased by 1 each. A character may not have any department higher than 4 at this stage.\n\n{b}FOCUSES:{/b} The character selects three focuses, at least one of which should relate to whichever department was increased by +2.\n\n{i}Examples include: Astronavigation, Composure, Diplomacy, Extra- Vehicular Activity, Evasive Action, Helm Operations, Inspiration, Persuasion, Small Craft, Starship Recognition, Starfleet Protocols, Team Dynamics{/i}\n\n{b}TALENT:{/b} The character gains a single talent." compset="CareerTrack" uniqueness="unique">
