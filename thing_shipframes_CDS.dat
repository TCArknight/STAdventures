  <thing id="fraDaedalu" name="Daedalus Class" description="Previous to the Earth-Romulan War, Starfleet needed a large vessel to help protect and patrol the few trade lanes and colonies United Earth had set up. The Daedalus class was designed to fill that role using the least amount of resources and the lowest amount of advanced technology as possible. The development and success of the NX class made the Admiralty begin to pull Daedalus-class ships back to the Sol System for possible decommissioning, but the Earth-Romulan War gave this vessel new life through Starfleet’s desperate need for vessels, allowing them to remain active until the late 2190s, with some being used even into the mid-23rd century." compset="Frame" uniqueness="unique">

    <fieldval field="fraCap" value="The low-tech design of the Daedalus class was due to its role as an escort for trade vessels and colony ships as well as routine scientific surveys, meaning its capabilities didn’t have to be exceptional. At maximum speed, the class could barely achieve warp 4 and its underpowered{br}impulse deck struggled at sublight speeds. The spaceframe itself was rudimentary with a simple cylinder for its engineering section and a sphere for the command section. The weapon systems that it carried were also primitive with first generation phase cannons and guided{br}missiles with thermonuclear payloads. The Daedalus class’s primitive systems proved its success in the early years of the Earth-Romulan War when it was seen that Starfleet{br}could build nearly four Daedalus-class vessels in the same amount of time as an NX class. Additionally, the primitive systems proved to be incredibly easy for even a moderately{br}experienced crew to maintain and repair. Minor upgrades near the end of the war gave these starships greater capabilities by replacing the nuclear weapons with photonic torpedoes and replacing the sensor suites onboard with state-of-the-art systems produced in conjunction with the Vulcans and Andorians. So many of these vessels were constructed by the end of the war that Starfleet mothballed half of them to be used as ‘hanger queens’ to make repair and refits of the still active vessels that much easier. Over its decades of service, Daedalus-class vessels saw dozens of minor and major refits that allowed them to continue active service in Starfleet until the limitations of the spaceframe became apparent when increasing hostilities{br}with the Klingon Empire in the 2250s and ’60s showed the vulnerability of the design. Starfleet quickly phased them out of active duty to be replaced by Constitution and Hermes-class starships."/>

The NX class was the result of the NX Project and Zefram Cochrane’s Warp Five Project that began prior to his disappearance. The NX class was experimental and groundbreaking in nearly every way, including its overall design. Unlike other UESPA and Starfleet vessels of the era, the NX class didn’t use the cylindrical or box-like hull configurations similar to 20th and 21st century submarines. Instead, the vessel had what would become a standard Starfleet aesthetic: a large saucer-like hull. Further, two long aft-trailing pontoons connected to the class’s experimental and powerful warp nacelles. The NX class would serve Starfleet for over a decade and was present at some of the most intense battles of the Earth-Romulan War." compset="Frame" uniqueness="unique">

The warp core, with significant modifications and with the tendency to use vast amounts of deuterium and antideuterium was able to reach warp 5.06, and during the Earth-Romulan War black-box records indicated that Atlantis reached a speed of warp 5.2 in the hours before its destruction. The vessels of the class were heavily armed for a starship of the time as it was thought to err on the side of caution when exploring areas humans had never been before. Three turreted phase cannons were mounted around the saucer to provide excellent coverage against attack from all angles, and six spatial torpedo launchers (four forward and two aft) gave the NX class a simulated advantage over possible opponents. The tactical systems were replaced on Enterprise in 2153 and installed on subsequent NX-class ships, with improved pulsed phase cannons and photonic torpedoes utilizing antimatter in their warheads. Polarized hull-plating and heavy internal bulkheads and structural bracing were used before deflector shield technology was developed. The ship’s shuttlebay was located on the ventral surface of the saucer. The two shuttlepods would ‘drop’ away from the starship when the polarity of the magnetic field of the articulated grappling arm was switched. Debris and small craft that were not under their own propulsion could be brought aboard by two ‘grapplers’ that could be latched on using both magnets and the servo mounted claws that would grip onto nearly any surface."/>

The Hermes class shared the same basic saucer-like primary hull and ‘neck’ dorsal as other vessels, that connected to a single warp  nacelle.

With the two sets of warp coils so close together, the Hermes class could maintain a strong field gradient for a minimal amount of power allowing it to maintain high warp velocities for longer. This meant that most commanding officers of a Hermes-class vessel could order their vessels to maintain a steady warp 7 and push emergency speeds above warp 9. Sublight propulsion was provided by the standard multistage fusion reactors at the aft of the primary hull. The weapon systems were comprised of only a single phaser bank on the ventral side of the hull, and no photon torpedo systems. The space this makes available in the saucer allows for the addition of extra sensor suites and laboratories networked through the vessel’s two large and powerful duotronic computer cores. The Hermes class wasn’t designed to include a shuttlebay as that space was required for sensor pallets, but it did have three separate docking ports that often carried small travel pods that could be used to move personnel and small amounts of cargo between the starship and orbital facilities and other starships."/>

Even at full power, the {i}Oberth{/i} class was limited to achieving warp 8 for brief periods and could only cruise at warp 5.

Inside was the planetary survey and subspace scanning equipment that made the {i}Oberth{/i} class useful for research. The isolated sensor networks, dedicated duotronic computer core and shielded electronics were mirrored on the port and starboard sides of the hull giving the ship interferometric sensor readings that were more detailed than what most starship systems could provide. The isolation of these sensors was necessary due to their sensitivity and high energy output, and unprotected humanoids could be exposed to high energy EM and subspace radiation while scanning operations were underway. The {i}Oberth{/i} class was taken out of active service in Starfleet after the introduction of isolinear computer systems that rendered most systems on the design obsolete, but a few of the class can still be seen used by Starfleet Academy as training vessels with their warp cores removed and by universities requiring mobile research vessels."/>

The roll-bar mount was much stronger structurally and provided more EPS connections than the {i}Miranda{/i} class and this allowed a far wider selection of modular pods to be made available for use on the design. The pods that are typically available for the {i}Nebula{/i} class at major starbases are: sensor array with multispectral and subspace interferometry, a subspace antenna array and repeater, additional matter/antimatter reactor core with two warp nacelles to provide an increased time at high warp speeds, shuttle or fighter launch bay, weapons pod including two type-10 phaser strips and six photon torpedo launchers, or a dedicated photon torpedo deck with sixteen individual launch systems."/>

To help with identification, the logo of Starfleet Medical is displayed prominently on each side of the primary hull. The main sickbay used for the crew was also located in the primary hull, but the hospital complex was located in the secondary hull.

Improvements in offensive and defensive technologies included the installation of deflector shield emitters, allowing it to survive in more hostile environmental conditions and the addition of two modular type- 4 phaser mounts. The addition of extra energy capacitors and power generation for these weapons also gave the Type-6 a higher warp speed, almost reaching warp 2. These shuttlecraft can be found assigned to nearly every Starfleet starbase and ground facilities across the Federation as well as most starships with shuttlebays large enough to hold them."/>

This heavy computer control was needed to keep the shuttle at superluminal velocities topping out at Warp 2.5. Without the computer assistance, a rookie pilot could easily cause the shuttle to drop to sublight speeds. The interior of the shuttle was large, capable of seating a minimum of two pilots and over ten passengers in comfort, triple that for short duration flights in emergency situations. Nearly all the shuttle&apos;s power was needed for propulsion, leaving little for deflector shields, and none for weapon systems. This lack of adequate defenses meant that starships operating away from Federation space rarely used the Type-7, they were usually assigned to starbases and star systems inside Federation territory."/>

  <thing id="fraShuttleType10" name="Shuttle (Type-10)" description="With the new smaller starships beginning to be put into production by Starfleet, compact shuttles were needed to give these vessels the versatility expected by the officers and enlisted of the service. To accomplish this, designers had to make compromises in the design, electing for compact systems rather than the best available for Federation shuttles. The Type-10 shuttlecraft, also known as the {i}Chaffee{/i} class, ended up using technology that had been discarded for a century or more as refinements to the equipment made them small enough to be required for this design. Loved and hated in equal measures by crew serving aboard them, the Type-10 is only permanently assigned to {i}Defiant{/i} and some {i}Nova{/i}-class starships.\n\n{b}SPECIAL RULES:{/b}\nThe Type 10 is difficult to repair while in space. Any attempt to repair a Type-10 shuttle in any environment other than a shuttlebay or other repair facility increases in Difficulty by 1. Repairs made in a proper repair facility reduce in Difficulty by 1 instead." compset="Frame" uniqueness="unique">

    <fieldval field="fraCap" value="The Type-10 can handle up to four crew (and double that number in emergencies), but typically only has a crew of two assigned for away missions. This interior space is surprising for such a small shuttle. The openness of the Type-10 is only made possible due to the shuttle&apos;s reliance on compact fusion reactors in its two engine pods for power. Without a bulky matter/ antimatter reactor, more of these small reactors, along with more capacitors allow the Type-10 to maintain a cruising speed of Warp 3 and a burst speed of Warp 5 that can be sustained for approximately thirty seconds. As the Type-10 is typically assigned to combat vessels or small and under-armed science vessels, it has three hard-mounted type-5 phaser strips, one on each engine pod and one on the nose of the shuttle. The Type-10 also has a hardpoint on its ventral surface that allows the mounting of a micro-torpedo launcher for a single-shot quantum torpedo. Crews often complained about how many systems were located outside on the engine pods. As EVA suits are not standard on the Type-10 due to their bulk, damage to propulsion systems and hull damage were very difficult to repair. This isn&apos;t typically an issue as reports of reactor damage to the Type-10 results in high-energy plasma burning through the entire engine pod, and damaging the hull, resulting in crews beaming to safety in the emergency transporter, and scuttling the shuttle rather than trying to salvage the radioactive scrap."/>

The fighter also has standard type-5 phaser strips along the edges of the vessel&apos;s warp nacelles, giving it wide firing arcs and providing accurate defensive fire against incoming heavy weapons. {br}{br}The fighter was never assumed to operate on its own, so the designers removed many of the original courier design&apos;s warp coils to provide extra internal space for larger fusion reactors for the impulse drive and shield emitters. This makes the fighter only able to maintain warp speeds for short durations, normally no more than thirty minutes to an hour at lower speeds, and makes it highly dependent on its parent vessel to deliver it close to the battle. As the fighter was based on an older and more reliable design, upgrading the civilian ship is fairly trivial and many Maquis cells use these upgraded vessels as attack ships in their fight against the Cardassians."/>
