  <thing id="fraDaedalu" name="Daedalus Class" description="Previous to the Earth-Romulan War, Starfleet\nneeded a large vessel to help protect and patrol the few trade\nlanes and colonies United Earth had set up. The Daedalus\nclass was designed to fill that role using the least amount of\nresources and the lowest amount of advanced technology\nas possible. The development and success of the NX class\nmade the Admiralty begin to pull Daedalus-class ships\nback to the Sol System for possible decommissioning, but\nthe Earth-Romulan War gave this vessel new life through\nStarfleet’s desperate need for vessels, allowing them to\nremain active until the late 2190s, with some being used even\ninto the mid-23rd century." compset="Frame" uniqueness="unique">

    <fieldval field="fraCap" value="The low-tech design of the Daedalus{br}class was due to its role as an escort for trade vessels and{br}colony ships as well as routine scientific surveys, meaning{br}its capabilities didn’t have to be exceptional. At maximum{br}speed, the class could barely achieve warp 4 and its underpowered{br}impulse deck struggled at sublight speeds. The{br}spaceframe itself was rudimentary with a simple cylinder{br}for its engineering section and a sphere for the command{br}section. The weapon systems that it carried were also{br}primitive with first generation phase cannons and guided{br}missiles with thermonuclear payloads. The Daedalus class’s{br}primitive systems proved its success in the early years of{br}the Earth-Romulan War when it was seen that Starfleet{br}could build nearly four Daedalus-class vessels in the same{br}amount of time as an NX class. Additionally, the primitive{br}systems proved to be incredibly easy for even a moderately{br}experienced crew to maintain and repair. Minor upgrades{br}near the end of the war gave these starships greater{br}capabilities by replacing the nuclear weapons with photonic{br}torpedoes and replacing the sensor suites onboard with{br}state-of-the-art systems produced in conjunction with{br}the Vulcans and Andorians. So many of these vessels{br}were constructed by the end of the war that Starfleet{br}mothballed half of them to be used as ‘hanger queens’ to{br}make repair and refits of the still active vessels that much{br}easier. Over its decades of service, Daedalus-class vessels{br}saw dozens of minor and major refits that allowed them to{br}continue active service in Starfleet until the limitations of the{br}spaceframe became apparent when increasing hostilities{br}with the Klingon Empire in the 2250s and ’60s showed{br}the vulnerability of the design. Starfleet quickly phased{br}them out of active duty to be replaced by Constitution and{br}Hermes-class starships."/>
